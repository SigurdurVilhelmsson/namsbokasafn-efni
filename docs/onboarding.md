4. Add notes explaining your choice

### Following Existing Decisions
1. Check the Decisions page (`/decisions`) for past choices
2. Look for decisions about the chapter you're working on
3. Follow established patterns for consistency

## When You're Stuck

### Common Issues and Solutions

**"I don't know how to translate this term"**
1. Check terminology database (`/terminology`)
2. Check decision log (`/decisions`)
3. If still unsure, add a comment: `<!-- SPURNING: How should "X" be translated? -->`

**"The machine translation is very wrong"**
- That's expected! Your job is to fix it
- Make necessary corrections
- Don't hesitate to rewrite entire sentences if needed

**"I found a formatting error"**
- Fix obvious formatting issues
- For structural problems, report at `/issues`

**"I disagree with a previous decision"**
- Continue following the decision for now
- Raise at next team meeting for discussion
- Don't change established terminology without approval

### Getting Help
1. **Quick questions**: Add comment in editor
2. **Terminology questions**: Propose term or check `/decisions`
3. **Technical problems**: Contact admin
4. **General questions**: Ask at weekly team meeting

## Review Process

### After You Submit
1. Your work goes to a reviewer (usually Head Editor)
2. They may:
   - **Approve**: Your work is accepted
   - **Request changes**: You'll see feedback and need to revise

### If Changes Are Requested
1. You'll see a banner on your work: "Breytingar óskast"
2. Read the reviewer's notes
3. Make the requested changes
4. Resubmit

### Review Timeline
- Aim to address requested changes within 2 days
- If you can't, communicate with the reviewer

## Tips for Success

1. **Save often** - Auto-save exists, but manual saves are safer
2. **Check terminology first** - Consistency is important
3. **Use comments** - When unsure, document your questions
4. **Communicate** - Ask if something is unclear
5. **Be consistent** - Follow established patterns
