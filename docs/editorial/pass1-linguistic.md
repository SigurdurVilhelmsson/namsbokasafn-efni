# Pass 1: Linguistic Review

This guide is for editors performing Pass 1 (linguistic review) of translations.

## Goal

Create a **faithful translation** - natural, accurate Icelandic that closely represents the source text.

**Critical:** Pass 1 produces a faithful translation that has independent value. Do NOT localize - that happens in Pass 2.

---

## What to Focus On

### DO

- Fix grammar and spelling errors
- Improve word choice for clarity
- Ensure natural Icelandic sentence structure
- Check terminology consistency (refer to glossary)
- Verify technical accuracy is preserved
- Ensure the translation is readable and flows well
- Flag passages that are unclear or potentially wrong

### DO NOT

- Convert units (keep miles, Fahrenheit, etc.)
- Change cultural references (keep American examples)
- Add Icelandic examples or context
- Remove or add content
- Localize anything

---

## Why Keep It Faithful?

The faithful translation has value because:
1. It can be cited academically
2. It serves as a baseline for the localized version
3. It allows readers to compare with the source
4. It updates the Translation Memory with human-verified content

---

## Process

1. **Receive** the .docx file from the translator
2. **Enable Track Changes** in Microsoft Word before making any edits
   - Review → Track Changes → Track Changes
   - Verify your name is set correctly
3. **Read through** the entire section once before editing
4. **Review systematically:**
   - Go section by section
   - Make edits using Track Changes
   - Add comments for questions or flagged issues
5. **Check terminology** against the glossary
6. **Save** your reviewed file

---

## Using Word Track Changes

All edits must be visible:
- Deletions should show strikethrough
- Insertions should be highlighted
- Use comments (Insert → Comment) for:
  - Questions about meaning
  - Terminology suggestions
  - Notes about uncertainty

---

## Terminology Questions

When you encounter a term that seems wrong or unclear:

1. Check [terminology.md](terminology.md)
2. Check the glossary in `glossary/terminology-en-is.csv`
3. Search [Íðorðabankinn](https://idord.arnastofnun.is/)
4. If still unsure, add a comment and flag for discussion

## Deliverables

- Reviewed .docx file with Track Changes
- Save to: `03-faithful/docx/ch##/`
- Naming: `[section]-pass1-[your initials].docx`

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's a Problem |
|---------|-------------------|
| Converting units | Pass 1 should be faithful to source |
| Adding examples | Changes should wait for Pass 2 |
| Forgetting Track Changes | Edits can't be incorporated into TM |
| Inconsistent terminology | Creates confusion for students |
