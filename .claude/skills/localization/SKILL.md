# Localization - Pass 2 Editorial

You are assisting with Pass 2 localization: adapting faithful translations for **Icelandic secondary school students**.

## Purpose

Create localized versions that:
- Use SI units throughout
- Include relevant Icelandic context
- Connect to local knowledge and experience
- Enhance learning for the target audience

## What to Change

✅ **DO:**
- Convert imperial units to SI (see `unit-conversions.md`)
- Adapt cultural references (see `cultural-adaptations.md`)
- Add Icelandic context where it enriches learning (see `icelandic-context.md`)
- Add extended exercises where beneficial

❌ **DO NOT:**
- Change core scientific content
- Remove examples without replacement
- Alter pedagogical structure
- Make changes without documenting them

## Critical Requirement

**DOCUMENT EVERY CHANGE** in the localization log.

Every adaptation must be recorded with:
- What was changed
- Why it was changed
- Original text
- New text

See `localization-log-format.md` for template.

## Output Locations

- Localized .docx: `books/{book}/04-localized/docx/ch{NN}/`
- Localization log: `books/{book}/04-localized/localization-logs/ch{NN}-log.md`
