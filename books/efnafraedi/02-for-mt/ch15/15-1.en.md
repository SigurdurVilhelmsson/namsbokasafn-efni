# Precipitation and Dissolution

## The Solubility Product

Recall from the chapter on solutions that the solubility of a substance can vary from essentially zero (**insoluble** or **sparingly soluble**) to infinity (**miscible**). A solute with finite solubility can yield a **saturated** solution when it is added to a solvent in an amount exceeding its solubility, resulting in a heterogeneous mixture of the saturated solution and the excess, undissolved solute. For example, a saturated solution of silver chloride is one in which the equilibrium shown below has been established.

In this solution, an excess of solid AgCl dissolves and dissociates to produce aqueous Ag^+^ and Cl^–^ ions at the same rate that these aqueous ions combine and precipitate to form solid AgCl ([↗](#CNX_Chem_15_01_AgCl)). Because silver chloride is a sparingly soluble salt, the equilibrium concentration of its dissolved ions in the solution is relatively low.

The equilibrium constant for solubility equilibria such as this one is called the solubility product constant, **K**~sp~, in this case

Recall that only gases and solutes are represented in equilibrium constant expressions, so the **K**~sp~ does not include a term for the undissolved AgCl. A listing of solubility product constants for several sparingly soluble compounds is provided in [Appendix J].

## Solution

For cases such as these, one may derive **K**~sp~ values from provided solubilities, or vice-versa. Calculations of this sort are most conveniently performed using a compound’s molar solubility, measured as moles of dissolved solute per liter of saturated solution.

### Using Barium Sulfate for Medical Imaging

Various types of medical imaging techniques are used to aid diagnoses of illnesses in a noninvasive manner. One such technique utilizes the ingestion of a barium compound before taking an X-ray image. A suspension of barium sulfate, a chalky powder, is ingested by the patient. Since the **K**~sp~ of barium sulfate is 10.08 [[EQ:54]] 10^–10^, very little of it dissolves as it coats the lining of the patient’s intestinal tract. Barium-coated areas of the digestive tract then appear on an X-ray as white, allowing for greater visual detail than a traditional X-ray ([↗](#CNX_Chem_15_01_BariumXray)).

Medical imaging using barium sulfate can be used to diagnose acid reflux disease, Crohn’s disease, and ulcers in addition to other conditions.

## Predicting Precipitation

The equation that describes the equilibrium between solid calcium carbonate and its solvated ions is:

It is important to realize that this equilibrium is established in any aqueous solution containing Ca^2+^ and CO~3~^2–^ ions, not just in a solution formed by saturating water with calcium carbonate. Consider, for example, mixing aqueous solutions of the soluble compounds sodium carbonate and calcium nitrate. If the concentrations of calcium and carbonate ions in the mixture do not yield a reaction quotient, Q~sp~, that exceeds the solubility product, **K**~sp~, then no precipitation will occur. If the ion concentrations yield a reaction quotient greater than the solubility product, then precipitation will occur, lowering those concentrations until equilibrium is established (Q~sp~ = **K**~sp~). The comparison of Q~sp~ to **K**~sp~ to predict precipitation is an example of the general approach to predicting the direction of a reaction first introduced in the chapter on equilibrium. For the specific case of solubility equilibria:

Q~sp~ &lt; **K**~sp~: the reaction proceeds in the forward direction (solution is not saturated; no precipitation observed)

Q~sp~ > **K**~sp~: the reaction proceeds in the reverse direction (solution is supersaturated; precipitation will occur)

This predictive strategy and related calculations are demonstrated in the next few example exercises.

In solutions containing two or more ions that may form insoluble compounds with the same counter ion, an experimental strategy called **selective precipitation**{#term-00001} may be used to remove individual ions from solution. By increasing the counter ion concentration in a controlled manner, ions in solution may be precipitated individually, assuming their compound solubilities are adequately different. In solutions with equal concentrations of target ions, the ion forming the least soluble compound will precipitate first (at the lowest concentration of counter ion), with the other ions subsequently precipitating as their compound’s solubilities are reached. As an illustration of this technique, the next example exercise describes separation of a two halide ions via precipitation of one as a silver salt.

### The Role of Precipitation in Wastewater Treatment

Solubility equilibria are useful tools in the treatment of wastewater carried out in facilities that may treat the municipal water in your city or town ([↗](#CNX_Chem_15_01_Wastewater)). Specifically, selective precipitation is used to remove contaminants from wastewater before it is released back into natural bodies of water. For example, phosphate ions [[EQ:92]] are often present in the water discharged from manufacturing facilities. An abundance of phosphate causes excess algae to grow, which impacts the amount of oxygen available for marine life as well as making water unsuitable for human consumption.

One common way to remove phosphates from water is by the addition of calcium hydroxide, or lime, Ca(OH)~2~. As the water is made more basic, the calcium ions react with phosphate ions to produce hydroxylapatite, Ca~5~(PO4)~3~OH, which then precipitates out of the solution:

Because the amount of calcium ion added does not result in exceeding the solubility products for other calcium salts, the anions of those salts remain behind in the wastewater. The precipitate is then removed by filtration and the water is brought back to a neutral pH by the addition of CO~2~ in a recarbonation process. Other chemicals can also be used for the removal of phosphates by precipitation, including iron(III) chloride and aluminum sulfate.

View this [site](http://openstax.org/l/16Wastewater) for more information on how phosphorus is removed from wastewater.

### Solution

Precipitation of Mg(OH)~2~ The first step in the preparation of magnesium metal is the precipitation of Mg(OH)~2~ from sea water by the addition of lime, Ca(OH)~2~, a readily available inexpensive source of OH^–^ ion:

The concentration of Mg^2+^(**aq**) in sea water is 0.0537 **M**. Will Mg(OH)~2~ precipitate when enough Ca(OH)~2~ is added to give a [OH^–^] of 0.0010 **M**?

Solution

Calculation of the reaction quotient under these conditions is shown here:

Because **Q** is greater than **K**~sp~ (**Q** = 5.4 [[EQ:58]] 10^–8^ is larger than **K**~sp~ = 8.9 [[EQ:59]] 10^–12^), the reverse reaction will proceed, precipitating magnesium hydroxide until the dissolved ion concentrations have been sufficiently lowered, so that Q~sp~ = **K**~sp~.

### Precipitation of AgCl

Precipitation of AgCl Does silver chloride precipitate when equal volumes of a 2.0 [[EQ:62]] 10^–4^-**M** solution of AgNO~3~ and a 2.0 [[EQ:63]] 10^–4^-**M** solution of NaCl are mixed?

Solution The equation for the equilibrium between solid silver chloride, silver ion, and chloride ion is:

The solubility product is 1.6 [[EQ:65]] 10^–10^ (see [Appendix J]).

AgCl will precipitate if the reaction quotient calculated from the concentrations in the mixture of AgNO~3~ and NaCl is greater than **K**~sp~. Because the volume doubles when equal volumes of AgNO~3~ and NaCl solutions are mixed, each concentration is reduced to half its initial value

The reaction quotient, **Q**, is greater than **K**~sp~ for AgCl, so a supersaturated solution is formed:

AgCl will precipitate from the mixture until the dissolution equilibrium is established, with **Q** equal to **K**~sp~.

### Precipitation of Silver Halides

Precipitation of Silver Halides A solution contains 0.00010 mol of KBr and 0.10 mol of KCl per liter. AgNO~3~ is gradually added to this solution. Which forms first, solid AgBr or solid AgCl?

Solution The two equilibria involved are:

If the solution contained about **equal** concentrations of Cl^–^ and Br^–^, then the silver salt with the smaller **K**~sp~ (AgBr) would precipitate first. The concentrations are not equal, however, so the [Ag^+^] at which AgCl begins to precipitate and the [Ag^+^] at which AgBr begins to precipitate must be calculated. The salt that forms at the lower [Ag^+^] precipitates first.

AgBr precipitates when **Q** equals **K**~sp~ for AgBr

AgBr begins to precipitate when [Ag^+^] is 5.0 [[EQ:97]] 10^–9^ **M**.

For AgCl: AgCl precipitates when **Q** equals **K**~sp~ for AgCl (1.6 [[EQ:98]] 10^–10^). When [Cl^–^] = 0.10 **M**:

AgCl begins to precipitate when [Ag^+^] is 1.6 [[EQ:101]] 10^–9^ **M**.

AgCl begins to precipitate at a lower [Ag^+^] than AgBr, so AgCl begins to precipitate first. Note the chloride ion concentration of the initial mixture was significantly greater than the bromide ion concentration, and so silver chloride precipitated first despite having a **K**~sp~ greater than that of silver bromide.

## Common Ion Effect

Compared with pure water, the solubility of an ionic compound is less in aqueous solutions containing a **common ion** (one also produced by dissolution of the ionic compound). This is an example of a phenomenon known as the **common ion effect**, which is a consequence of the law of mass action that may be explained using Le ChÂtelier’s principle. Consider the dissolution of silver iodide:

This solubility equilibrium may be shifted left by the addition of either silver(I) or iodide ions, resulting in the precipitation of AgI and lowered concentrations of dissolved Ag^+^ and I^–^. In solutions that already contain either of these ions, less AgI may be dissolved than in solutions without these ions.

This effect may also be explained in terms of mass action as represented in the solubility product expression:

The mathematical product of silver(I) and iodide ion molarities is constant in an equilibrium mixture **regardless of the source of the ions**, and so an increase in one ion’s concentration must be balanced by a proportional decrease in the other.

(a) MgCl~2~

(b) KOH

(c) NaNO~3~

(d) Mg(OH)~2~

Solution The solubility equilibrium is

(a) Adding a common ion, Mg^2+^, will increase the concentration of this ion and shift the solubility equilibrium to the left, decreasing the concentration of hydroxide ion and increasing the amount of undissolved magnesium hydroxide.

(b) Adding a common ion, OH^–^, will increase the concentration of this ion and shift the solubility equilibrium to the left, decreasing the concentration of magnesium ion and increasing the amount of undissolved magnesium hydroxide.

(c) The added compound does not contain a common ion, and no effect on the magnesium hydroxide solubility equilibrium is expected.

(d) Adding more solid magnesium hydroxide will increase the amount of undissolved compound in the mixture. The solution is already saturated, though, so the concentrations of dissolved magnesium and hydroxide ions will remain the same.

## Key Concepts and Summary

The equilibrium constant for an equilibrium involving the precipitation or dissolution of a slightly soluble ionic solid is called the solubility product, **K**~sp~, of the solid. For a heterogeneous equilibrium involving the slightly soluble solid M~**p**~X~**q**~ and its ions M^m+^ and X^n–^:

the solubility product expression is:

The solubility product of a slightly soluble electrolyte can be calculated from its solubility; conversely, its solubility can be calculated from its **K**~sp~, provided the only significant reaction that occurs when the solid dissolves is the formation of its ions.

A slightly soluble electrolyte begins to precipitate when the magnitude of the reaction quotient for the dissolution reaction exceeds the magnitude of the solubility product. Precipitation continues until the reaction quotient equals the solubility product.

The carbonate ion concentration is gradually increased in a solution containing equal concentrations of the divalent cations of magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, and manganese. Which of the following carbonates will precipitate first? Which will precipitate last? Explain.

(a) [[EQ:273]]

(b) [[EQ:274]]

(c) [[EQ:275]]

(d) [[EQ:276]]

(e) [[EQ:277]]

:::answer
MnCO~3~ will form first since it has the smallest **K**~sp~ value among these homologous compounds and is therefore the least soluble. MgCO~3~•3H~2~O will be the last to precipitate since it has the largest K_sp value and is the most soluble. **K**~sp~ value.

Solubility equilibria are established when the dissolution and precipitation of a solute species occur at equal rates. These equilibria underlie many natural and technological processes, ranging from tooth decay to water purification. An understanding of the factors affecting compound solubility is, therefore, essential to the effective management of these processes. This section applies previously introduced equilibrium concepts and tools to systems involving dissolution and precipitation.
