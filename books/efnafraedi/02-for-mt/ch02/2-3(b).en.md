## Atomic Mass

Because each proton and each neutron contribute approximately one amu to the mass of an atom, and each electron contributes far less, the **atomic mass**{id="term-00011"} of a single atom is approximately equal to its mass number (a whole number). However, the average masses of atoms of most elements are not whole numbers because most elements exist naturally as mixtures of two or more isotopes.

The mass of an element shown in a periodic table or listed in a table of atomic masses is a weighted, average mass of all the isotopes present in a naturally occurring sample of that element. This is equal to the sum of each individual isotope’s mass multiplied by its fractional abundance.

[[EQ:2]]{id="fs-idm56955264"}

For example, the element boron is composed of two isotopes: About 19.9% of all boron atoms are ^10^B with a mass of 10.0129 amu, and the remaining 80.1% are ^11^B with a mass of 11.0093 amu. The average atomic mass for boron is calculated to be:

[[EQ:3]]{id="fs-idp64426960"}

It is important to understand that no single boron atom weighs exactly 10.8 amu; 10.8 amu is the average mass of all boron atoms, and individual boron atoms weigh either approximately 10 amu or 11 amu.

::: example
### Example 2.1: Calculation of Average Atomic Mass

A meteorite found in central Indiana contains traces of the noble gas neon picked up from the solar wind during the meteorite’s trip through the solar system. Analysis of a sample of the gas showed that it consisted of 91.84% ^20^Ne (mass 19.9924 amu), 0.47% ^21^Ne (mass 20.9940 amu), and 7.69% ^22^Ne (mass 21.9914 amu). What is the average mass of the neon in the solar wind?

**Solution**

[[EQ:4]]{id="fs-idm73306928"}

The average mass of a neon atom in the solar wind is 20.15 amu. (The average mass of a terrestrial neon atom is 20.1796 amu. This result demonstrates that we may find slight differences in the natural abundance of isotopes, depending on their origin.)

**Check Your Learning**

A sample of magnesium is found to contain 78.70% of ^24^Mg atoms (mass 23.98 amu), 10.13% of ^25^Mg atoms (mass 24.99 amu), and 11.17% of ^26^Mg atoms (mass 25.98 amu). Calculate the average mass of a Mg atom.

24.31 amu

:::note
### Answer:

24.31 amu

:::

We can also do variations of this type of calculation, as shown in the next example.

::: example
### Example 2.2: Calculation of Percent Abundance

Naturally occurring chlorine consists of ^35^Cl (mass 34.96885 amu) and ^37^Cl (mass 36.96590 amu), with an average mass of 35.453 amu. What is the percent composition of Cl in terms of these two isotopes?

**Solution**

The average mass of chlorine is the fraction that is ^35^Cl times the mass of ^35^Cl plus the fraction that is ^37^Cl times the mass of ^37^Cl.

[[EQ:5]]{id="fs-idp1748832"}

If we let *x* represent the fraction that is ^35^Cl, then the fraction that is ^37^Cl is represented by 1.00 − *x*.

(The fraction that is ^35^Cl + the fraction that is ^37^Cl must add up to 1, so the fraction of ^37^Cl must equal 1.00 − the fraction of ^35^Cl.)

Substituting this into the average mass equation, we have:

[[EQ:6]]{id="fs-idm50612880"}

So solving yields: *x* = 0.7576, which means that 1.00 − 0.7576 = 0.2424. Therefore, chlorine consists of 75.76% ^35^Cl and 24.24% ^37^Cl.

Naturally occurring copper consists of ^63^Cu (mass 62.9296 amu) and ^65^Cu (mass 64.9278 amu), with an average mass of 63.546 amu. What is the percent composition of Cu in terms of these two isotopes?

As you will learn, isotopes are important in nature and especially in human understanding of science and medicine. Let's consider just one natural, stable isotope: Oxygen-18, which is noted in the table above and is referred to as one of the environmental isotopes. It is important in paleoclimatology, for example, because scientists can use the ratio between Oxygen-18 and Oxygen-16 in an ice core to determine the temperature of precipitation over time. Oxygen-18 was also critical to the discovery of metabolic pathways and the mechanisms of enzymes. Mildred Cohn pioneered the usage of these isotopes to act as tracers, so that researchers could follow their path through reactions and gain a better understanding of what is happening. One of her first discoveries provided insight into the phosphorylation of glucose that takes place in mitochondria. And the methods of using isotopes for this research contributed to entire fields of study.

The occurrence and natural abundances of isotopes can be experimentally determined using an instrument called a mass spectrometer. Mass spectrometry (MS) is widely used in chemistry, forensics, medicine, environmental science, and many other fields to analyze and help identify the substances in a sample of material. In a typical mass spectrometer ([↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_02_03_MassSpec"}), the sample is vaporized and exposed to a high-energy electron beam that causes the sample’s atoms (or molecules) to become electrically charged, typically by losing one or more electrons. These cations then pass through a (variable) electric or magnetic field that deflects each cation’s path to an extent that depends on both its mass and charge (similar to how the path of a large steel ball rolling past a magnet is deflected to a lesser extent than that of a small steel ball). The ions are detected, and a plot of the relative number of ions generated versus their mass-to-charge ratios (a *mass spectrum*) is made. The height of each vertical feature or peak in a mass spectrum is proportional to the fraction of cations with the specified mass-to-charge ratio. Since its initial use during the development of modern atomic theory, MS has evolved to become a powerful tool for chemical analysis in a wide range of applications.

![](CNX_Chem_02_03_MassSpec.jpg){id="CNX_Chem_02_03_MassSpec" alt="The left diagram shows how a mass spectrometer works, which is primarily a large tube that bends downward at its midpoint. The sample enters on the left side of the tube. A heater heats the sample, causing it to vaporize. The sample is also hit with a beam of electrons as it is being vaporized. Charged particles from the sample, called ions, are then accelerated and pass between two magnets. The magnetic field deflects the lightest ions most. The deflection of the ions is measured by a detector located on the right side of the tube. The graph to the right of the spectrometer shows a mass spectrum of zirconium. The relative abundance, as a percentage from 0 to 100, is graphed on the y axis, and the mass to charge ratio is graphed on the x axis. The sample contains five different isomers of zirconium. Z R 90, which has a mass to charge ratio of 90, is the most abundant isotope at about 51 percent relative abundance. Z R 91 has a mass to charge ratio of 91 and a relative abundance of about 11 percent. Z R 92 has a mass to charge ratio of 92 and a relative abundance of about 18 percent. Z R 94 has a mass to charge ratio of 94 and a relative abundance of about 18 percent. Z R 96, which has a mass to charge ratio of 96, is the least abundant zirconium isotope with a relative abundance of about 2 percent."}

## Key Concepts and Summary

An atom consists of a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons. The nucleus contains protons and neutrons; its diameter is about 100,000 times smaller than that of the atom. The mass of one atom is usually expressed in atomic mass units (amu), which is referred to as the atomic mass. An amu is defined as exactly [[EQ:38]] of the mass of a carbon-12 atom and is equal to 1.6605 [[EQ:39]] 10^−24^ g.

Protons are relatively heavy particles with a charge of 1+ and a mass of 1.0073 amu. Neutrons are relatively heavy particles with no charge and a mass of 1.0087 amu. Electrons are light particles with a charge of 1− and a mass of 0.00055 amu. The number of protons in the nucleus is called the atomic number (Z) and is the property that defines an atom’s elemental identity. The sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is called the mass number and, expressed in amu, is approximately equal to the mass of the atom. An atom is neutral when it contains equal numbers of electrons and protons.

Isotopes of an element are atoms with the same atomic number but different mass numbers; isotopes of an element, therefore, differ from each other only in the number of neutrons within the nucleus. When a naturally occurring element is composed of several isotopes, the atomic mass of the element represents the average of the masses of the isotopes involved. A chemical symbol identifies the atoms in a substance using symbols, which are one-, two-, or three-letter abbreviations for the atoms.
