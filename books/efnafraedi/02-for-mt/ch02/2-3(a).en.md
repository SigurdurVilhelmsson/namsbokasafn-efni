The development of modern atomic theory revealed much about the inner structure of atoms. It was learned that an atom contains a very small nucleus composed of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons, surrounded by a much larger volume of space containing negatively charged electrons. The nucleus contains the majority of an atom’s mass because protons and neutrons are much heavier than electrons, whereas electrons occupy almost all of an atom’s volume. The diameter of an atom is on the order of 10^−10^ m, whereas the diameter of the nucleus is roughly 10^−15^ m—about 100,000 times smaller. For a perspective about their relative sizes, consider this: If the nucleus were the size of a blueberry, the atom would be about the size of a football stadium ([↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_02_03_AtomSize"}).

The figure on the right shows a photograph of a person with a handful of blueberries."}

Atoms—and the protons, neutrons, and electrons that compose them—are extremely small. For example, a carbon atom weighs less than 2 [[EQ:7]] 10^−23^ g, and an electron has a charge of less than 2 [[EQ:8]] 10^−19^ C (coulomb). When describing the properties of tiny objects such as atoms, we use appropriately small units of measure, such as the **unified atomic mass unit (u)**{id="term-00001"} and the **fundamental unit of charge (e)**{id="term-00002"}. The unified atomic mass unit is defined as exactly 1/12 of the mass of a single atom of the carbon-12 isotope (more on isotopes is provided later in this section) and is equal to 1.6605 [[EQ:9]] 10^−24^ g. The **dalton (Da)**{id="term-00003"} is an alternative mass unit that is equivalent to the u. Many literature resources, including this text, use the older term atomic mass unit (amu) when referring to the u or the Da. The fundamental unit of charge (also called the elementary charge) equals the magnitude of the charge of an electron (e) with e = 1.602 [[EQ:10]] 10^−19^ C.

A proton has a mass of 1.0073 amu and a charge of 1+. A neutron is a slightly heavier particle with a mass 1.0087 amu and a charge of zero; as its name suggests, it is neutral. The electron has a charge of 1− and is a much lighter particle with a mass of about 0.00055 amu (it would take about 1800 electrons to equal the mass of one proton). The properties of these fundamental particles are summarized in [↗]{ref="fs-idp90857696"}. (An observant student might notice that the sum of an atom’s subatomic particles does not equal the atom’s actual mass: The total mass of six protons, six neutrons, and six electrons is 12.0993 amu, slightly larger than 12.00 amu. This “missing” mass is known as the mass defect, and you will learn about it in the chapter on nuclear chemistry.)

The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is its **atomic number (Z)**{id="term-00005"}. This is the defining trait of an element: Its value determines the identity of the atom. For example, any atom that contains six protons is the element carbon and has the atomic number 6, regardless of how many neutrons or electrons it may have. A neutral atom must contain the same number of positive and negative charges, so the number of protons equals the number of electrons. Therefore, the atomic number also indicates the number of electrons in an atom. The total number of protons and neutrons in an atom is called its **mass number (A)**{id="term-00006"}. The number of neutrons is therefore the difference between the mass number and the atomic number: A – Z = number of neutrons.

[[EQ:1]]{id="fs-idp109266704"}

Atoms are electrically neutral if they contain the same number of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons. When the numbers of these subatomic particles are *not* equal, the atom is electrically charged and is called an **ion**{id="term-00007"}. The charge of an atom is defined as follows:

Atomic charge = number of protons − number of electrons

As will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter, atoms (and molecules) typically acquire charge by gaining or losing electrons. An atom that gains one or more electrons will exhibit a negative charge and is called an **anion**{id="term-00008"}. Positively charged atoms called **cations**{id="term-00009"} are formed when an atom loses one or more electrons. For example, a neutral sodium atom (Z = 11) has 11 electrons. If this atom loses one electron, it will become a cation with a 1+ charge (11 − 10 = 1+). A neutral oxygen atom (Z = 8) has eight electrons, and if it gains two electrons it will become an anion with a 2− charge (8 − 10 = 2−).

Composition of an Atom Iodine is an essential trace element in our diet; it is needed to produce thyroid hormone. Insufficient iodine in the diet can lead to the development of a goiter, an enlargement of the thyroid gland ([↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_02_03_Iodine"}).

![](CNX_Chem_02_03_Iodine.jpg){id="CNX_Chem_02_03_Iodine" class="scaled-down" alt="Figure A shows a photo of a person who has a very swollen thyroid in his or her neck. Figure B shows a photo of a canister of iodized salt."}

*Figure: (a) Insufficient iodine in the diet can cause an enlargement of the thyroid gland called a goiter. (b) The addition of small amounts of iodine to salt, which prevents the formation of goiters, has helped eliminate this concern in the US where salt consumption is high.

The addition of small amounts of iodine to table salt (iodized salt) has essentially eliminated this health concern in the United States, but as much as 40% of the world’s population is still at risk of iodine deficiency. The iodine atoms are added as anions, and each has a 1− charge and a mass number of 127. Determine the numbers of protons, neutrons, and electrons in one of these iodine anions.

SolutionThe atomic number of iodine (53) tells us that a neutral iodine atom contains 53 protons in its nucleus and 53 electrons outside its nucleus. Because the sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons equals the mass number, 127, the number of neutrons is 74 (127 − 53 = 74). Since the iodine is added as a 1− anion, the number of electrons is 54 [53 – (1–) = 54].

## Chemical Symbols

A **chemical symbol**{id="term-00010"} is an abbreviation that we use to indicate an element or an atom of an element. For example, the symbol for mercury is Hg ([↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_02_03_SiSymbol"}). We use the same symbol to indicate one atom of mercury (microscopic domain) or to label a container of many atoms of the element mercury (macroscopic domain).

![](CNX_Chem_02_03_SiSymbol.jpg){id="CNX_Chem_02_03_SiSymbol" class="scaled-down" alt="A jar labeled “H g” is shown with a small amount of liquid mercury in it."}

*Figure 2.1: The symbol Hg represents the element mercury regardless of the amount; it could represent one atom of mercury or a large amount of mercury.*{id="CNX_Chem_02_03_SiSymbol"}

The symbols for several common elements and their atoms are listed in [↗]{ref="fs-idm36686800"}. Some symbols are derived from the common name of the element; others are abbreviations of the name in another language. Most symbols have one or two letters, but three-letter symbols have been used to describe some elements that have atomic numbers greater than 112. To avoid confusion with other notations, only the first letter of a symbol is capitalized. For example, Co is the symbol for the element cobalt, but CO is the notation for the compound carbon monoxide, which contains atoms of the elements carbon (C) and oxygen (O). All known elements and their symbols are in the periodic table in [↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_02_05_PerTable1"} (also found in [Appendix A]{ref="fs-idm379479808"}).

Traditionally, the discoverer (or discoverers) of a new element names the element. However, until the name is recognized by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the recommended name of the new element is based on the Latin word(s) for its atomic number. For example, element 106 was called unnilhexium (Unh), element 107 was called unnilseptium (Uns), and element 108 was called unniloctium (Uno) for several years. These elements are now named after scientists (or occasionally locations); for example, element 106 is now known as *seaborgium* (Sg) in honor of Glenn Seaborg, a Nobel Prize winner who was active in the discovery of several heavy elements. Element 109 was named in honor of Lise Meitner, who discovered nuclear fission, a phenomenon that would have world-changing impacts; Meitner also contributed to the discovery of some major isotopes, discussed immediately below.

## Isotopes

The symbol for a specific isotope of any element is written by placing the mass number as a superscript to the left of the element symbol ([↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_02_03_AtomSym"}). The atomic number is sometimes written as a subscript preceding the symbol, but since this number defines the element’s identity, as does its symbol, it is often omitted. For example, magnesium exists as a mixture of three isotopes, each with an atomic number of 12 and with mass numbers of 24, 25, and 26, respectively. These isotopes can be identified as ^24^Mg, ^25^Mg, and ^26^Mg. These isotope symbols are read as “element, mass number” and can be symbolized consistent with this reading. For instance, ^24^Mg is read as “magnesium 24,” and can be written as “magnesium-24” or “Mg-24.” ^25^Mg is read as “magnesium 25,” and can be written as “magnesium-25” or “Mg-25.” All magnesium atoms have 12 protons in their nucleus. They differ only because a ^24^Mg atom has 12 neutrons in its nucleus, a ^25^Mg atom has 13 neutrons, and a ^26^Mg has 14 neutrons.

![](CNX_Chem_02_03_AtomSym.jpg){id="CNX_Chem_02_03_AtomSym" class="scaled-down" alt="This diagram shows the symbol for helium, “H e.” The number to the upper left of the symbol is the mass number, which is 4. The number to the upper right of the symbol is the charge which is positive 2. The number to the lower left of the symbol is the atomic number, which is 2. This number is often omitted. Also shown is “M g” which stands for magnesium It has a mass number of 24, a charge of positive 2, and an atomic number of 12."}

*Figure 2.2: The symbol for an atom indicates the element via its usual two-letter symbol, the mass number as a left superscript, the atomic number as a left subscript (sometimes omitted), and the charge as a right superscript.*{id="CNX_Chem_02_03_AtomSym"}

Information about the naturally occurring isotopes of elements with atomic numbers 1 through 10 is given in [↗]{ref="fs-idm87646592"}. Note that in addition to standard names and symbols, the isotopes of hydrogen are often referred to using common names and accompanying symbols. Hydrogen-2, symbolized ^2^H, is also called deuterium and sometimes symbolized D. Hydrogen-3, symbolized ^3^H, is also called tritium and sometimes symbolized T.
