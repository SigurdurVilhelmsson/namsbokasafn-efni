## Figures

### CNX_Chem_02_06_NaCation

**Caption:** (a) A sodium atom (Na) has equal numbers of protons and electrons (11) and is uncharged. (b) A sodium cation (Na^+^) has lost an electron, so it has one more proton (11) than electrons (10), giving it an overall positive charge, signified by a superscripted plus sign.

**Alt text:** Figure A shows a sodium atom, N a, which has a nucleus containing 11 protons and 12 neutrons. The atom’s surrounding electron cloud contains 11 electrons. Figure B shows a sodium ion, N a superscript plus sign. Its nucleus contains 11 protons and 12 neutrons. The ion’s electron cloud contains 10 electrons and is smaller than that of the sodium atom in figure A.

### CNX_Chem_02_06_IonCharges

**Caption:** Some elements exhibit a regular pattern of ionic charge when they form ions.
