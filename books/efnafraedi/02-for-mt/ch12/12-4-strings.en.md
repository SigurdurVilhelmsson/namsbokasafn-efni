## Figures

### CNX_Chem_12_04_FrstOKin

**Caption:** A linear relationship between ln[H~2~O~2~] and time suggests the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is a first-order reaction.

**Alt text:** A graph is shown with the label “Time ( h )” on the x-axis and “l n [ H subscript 2 O subscript 2 ]” on the y-axis. The x-axis shows markings at 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours. The vertical axis shows markings at negative 3, negative 2, negative 1, and 0. A decreasing linear trend line is drawn through five points represented at the coordinates (0, 0), (6, negative 0.693), (12, negative 1.386), (18, negative 2.079), and (24, negative 2.772).

### CNX_Chem_12_04_2OrdKin

**Caption:** These two graphs show first- and second-order plots for the dimerization of C~4~H~6~. The linear trend in the second-order plot (right) indicates that the reaction follows second-order kinetics.

**Alt text:** Two graphs are shown, each with the label “Time ( s )” on the x-axis. The graph on the left is labeled, “l n [ C subscript 4 H subscript 6 ],” on the y-axis. The graph on the right is labeled “1 divided by [ C subscript 4 H subscript 6 ],” on the y-axis. The x-axes for both graphs show markings at 3000 and 6000. The y-axis for the graph on the left shows markings at negative 6, negative 5, and negative 4. A decreasing slightly concave up curve is drawn through five points at coordinates that are (0, negative 4.605), (1600, negative 5.289), (3200, negative 5.692), (4800, negative 5.978), and (6200, negative 6.175).
