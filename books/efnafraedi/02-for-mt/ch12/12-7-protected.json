      "summary": "This table has two columns and seven rows. The first row is a header row, and it labels each column, “Class,” and, “Function.” Under the “Class” column are the following: “oxidoreductases,” “transferases,” “hydrolases,” “lyases,” “isomerases,” and “ligases.” Under the “Function” column are the following: “redox reactions,” “transfer of functional groups,” “hydrolysis reactions,” “group elimination to form double bonds,” “isomerization,” and “bond formation with ATP hydrolysis.”"
