The isomerization of cyclobutene to butadiene is first-order and the rate constant has been measured as 2.0 [[MATH:109]] 10^−4^ s^−1^ at 150 °C in a 0.53-L flask. Determine the partial pressure of cyclobutene and its concentration after 30.0 minutes if an isomerization reaction is carried out at 150 °C with an initial pressure of 55 torr.
