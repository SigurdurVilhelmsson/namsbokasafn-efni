The rate laws discussed thus far relate the rate and the concentrations of reactants. We can also determine a second form of each rate law that relates the concentrations of reactants and time. These are called __integrated rate laws__. We can use an integrated rate law to determine the amount of reactant or product present after a period of time or to estimate the time required for a reaction to proceed to a certain extent. For example, an integrated rate law is used to determine the length of time a radioactive material must be stored for its radioactivity to decay to a safe level.

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idp93158656}}
Using calculus, the differential rate law for a chemical reaction can be integrated with respect to time to give an equation that relates the amount of reactant or product present in a reaction mixture to the elapsed time of the reaction. This process can either be very straightforward or very complex, depending on the complexity of the differential rate law. For purposes of discussion, we will focus on the resulting integrated rate laws for first-, second-, and zero-order reactions.

First-Order Reactions

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idm144782000}}
Integration of the rate law for a simple first-order reaction (rate = *k*[*A*]) results in an equation describing how the reactant concentration varies with time:

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idm63176528}}
where [*A*]*t* is the concentration of *A* at any time *t*, [*A*]~0~ is the initial concentration of *A*, and *k* is the first-order rate constant.

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idm512172928}}
For mathematical convenience, this equation may be rearranged to other formats, including direct and indirect proportionalities:

{{SEG:m68791:para-title:fs-idm133511056-title}}
Solution

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idm133511056}}
Since the relative change in reactant concentration is provided, a convenient format for the integrated rate law is:

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idm149413632}}
The initial concentration of C~4~H~8~, [*A*]~0~, is not provided, but the provision that 80.0% of the sample has decomposed is enough information to solve this problem. Let *x* be the initial concentration, in which case the concentration after 80.0% decomposition is 20.0% of *x* or 0.200*x.* Rearranging the rate law to isolate *t* and substituting the provided quantities yields:

A plot of ln[*A*]*t* versus *t* for a first-order reaction is a straight line with a slope of −*k* and a *y*-intercept of ln[*A*]~0~. If a set of rate data are plotted in this fashion but do *not* result in a straight line, the reaction is not first order in *A*.

Second-Order Reactions

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idm75401888}}
The equations that relate the concentrations of reactants and the rate constant of second-order reactions can be fairly complicated. To illustrate the point with minimal complexity, only the simplest second-order reactions will be described here, namely, those whose rates depend on the concentration of just one reactant. For these types of reactions, the differential rate law is written as:

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idm55886848}}
For these second-order reactions, the integrated rate law is:

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idm19194496}}
where the terms in the equation have their usual meanings as defined earlier.

The reaction of butadiene gas (C~4~H~6~) to yield C~8~H~12~ gas is described by the equation:

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idp68803280}}
This “dimerization” reaction is second order with a rate constant equal to 5.76 [[MATH:3]] 10^−2^ L mol^−1^ min^−1^ under certain conditions. If the initial concentration of butadiene is 0.200 *M*, what is the concentration after 10.0 min?

{{SEG:m68791:para-title:fs-idm47025104-title}}
Solution

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idm47025104}}
For a second-order reaction, the integrated rate law is written

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idm25993952}}
We know three variables in this equation: [*A*]~0~ = 0.200 mol/L, *k* = 5.76 [[MATH:4]] 10^−2^ L/mol/min, and *t* = 10.0 min. Therefore, we can solve for [*A*], the fourth variable:

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idm85057584}}
Therefore 0.179 mol/L of butadiene remain at the end of 10.0 min, compared to the 0.200 mol/L that was originally present.

In order to distinguish a first-order reaction from a second-order reaction, prepare a plot of ln[C~4~H~6~]*t* versus *t* and compare it to a plot of [[MATH:12]] versus *t*. The values needed for these plots follow.

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idp69115360}}
The plots are shown in {{XREF:5}}, which clearly shows the plot of ln[C~4~H~6~]*t* versus *t* is not linear, therefore the reaction is not first order. The plot of [[MATH:13]] versus *t* is linear, indicating that the reaction is second order.

Zero-Order Reactions

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idp474768}}
For zero-order reactions, the differential rate law is:

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idm91448320}}
A zero-order reaction thus exhibits a constant reaction rate, regardless of the concentration of its reactant(s). This may seem counterintuitive, since the reaction rate certainly can’t be finite when the reactant concentration is zero. For purposes of this introductory text, it will suffice to note that zero-order kinetics are observed for some reactions only under certain specific conditions. These same reactions exhibit different kinetic behaviors when the specific conditions aren’t met, and for this reason the more prudent term *pseudo-zero-order* is sometimes used.

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idp73236848}}
The integrated rate law for a zero-order reaction is a linear function:

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idm99514160}}
A plot of [*A*] versus *t* for a zero-order reaction is a straight line with a slope of *−k* and a *y*-intercept of [*A*]~0~. {{XREF:6}} shows a plot of [NH~3~] versus *t* for the thermal decomposition of ammonia at the surface of two different heated solids. The decomposition reaction exhibits first-order behavior at a quartz (SiO~2~) surface, as suggested by the exponentially decaying plot of concentration versus time. On a tungsten surface, however, the plot is linear, indicating zero-order kinetics.

The Half-Life of a Reaction

{{SEG:m68791:title:fs-idm97307168-title}}
First-Order Reactions

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idp162624}}
An equation relating the half-life of a first-order reaction to its rate constant may be derived from the integrated rate law as follows:

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idp33747664}}
Invoking the definition of half-life, symbolized [[MATH:23]] requires that the concentration of *A* at this point is one-half its initial concentration: [[MATH:24]] [[MATH:25]]

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idp123084256}}
Substituting these terms into the rearranged integrated rate law and simplifying yields the equation for half-life:

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idm124479504}}
This equation describes an expected inverse relation between the half-life of the reaction and its rate constant, *k*. Faster reactions exhibit larger rate constants and correspondingly shorter half-lives. Slower reactions exhibit smaller rate constants and longer half-lives.
