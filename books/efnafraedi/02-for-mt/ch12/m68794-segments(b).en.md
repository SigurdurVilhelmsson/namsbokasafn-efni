Based on the data presented, which of these is the rate determining step? Show that the mechanism is consistent with the observed rate law for the reaction and the overall stoichiometry of the reaction.

{{SEG:m68794:solution:fs-idp77008528}}
(a) Doubling [H~2~] doubles the rate. [H~2~] must enter the rate law to the first power. Doubling [NO] increases the rate by a factor of 4. [NO] must enter the rate law to the second power. (b) Rate = *k* [NO]^2^[H~2~]; (c) *k* = 5.0 [[MATH:22]] 10^3^ mol^2^ L^−2^ min^−1^; (d) 0.0050 mol/L; (e) Step II is the rate-determining step. If step I gives N~2~O~2~ in adequate amount, steps 1 and 2 combine to give [[MATH:23]] This reaction corresponds to the observed rate law. Combine steps 1 and 2 with step 3, which occurs by supposition in a rapid fashion, to give the appropriate stoichiometry.
