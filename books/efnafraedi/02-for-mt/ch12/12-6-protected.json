      "summary": "This table has four columns and five rows. The first row is a header row and it labels each column, “Experiment,” “Initial Concentration [ N O ] ( mol / L ),” “Initial Concentration, [ H subscript 2 ] ( mol / L ),” and “Initial Rate of Formation of N subscript 2 ( mol / L min ).” Under the “Experiment” columns are the numbers: 1, 2, 3, and 4. Under the “Initial Concentration [ N O ] ( mol / L )” column are the numbers: 0.0060, 0.0060, 0.0010, and 0.0020. Under the “Initial Concentration, [ H subscript 2 ] ( mol / L )” column are the numbers: 0.0010, 0.0020, 0.0060, 0.0060. Under the “Initial Rate of Formation of N subscript 2 ( mol / L min )” are the numbers: 1.8 times ten to the negative 4; 3.6 times ten to the negative 4; 0.30 times ten to the negative 4; and 1.2 times ten to the negative 4."
