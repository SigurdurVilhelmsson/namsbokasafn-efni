In some of our examples, the reaction orders in the rate law happen to be the same as the coefficients in the chemical equation for the reaction. This is merely a coincidence and very often not the case.

{{SEG:m68789:para:fs-idm178764304}}
Rate laws may exhibit fractional orders for some reactants, and negative reaction orders are sometimes observed when an increase in the concentration of one reactant causes a decrease in reaction rate. A few examples illustrating these points are provided:

{{SEG:m68789:para:fs-idm284144576}}
It is important to note that *rate laws are determined by experiment only and are not reliably predicted by reaction stoichiometry.*

The units for a rate constant will vary as appropriate to accommodate the overall order of the reaction. The unit of the rate constant for the second-order reaction described in {{XREF:3}} was determined to be [[MATH:62]] For the third-order reaction described in {{XREF:4}}, the unit for *k* was derived to be [[MATH:63]] Dimensional analysis requires the rate constant unit for a reaction whose overall order is *x* to be [[MATH:64]] {{XREF:5}} summarizes the rate constant units for common reaction orders.

Key Concepts and Summary

{{SEG:m68789:para:fs-idm262547408}}
Rate laws (*differential rate laws*) provide a mathematical description of how changes in the concentration of a substance affect the rate of a chemical reaction. Rate laws are determined experimentally and cannot be predicted by reaction stoichiometry. The order of reaction describes how much a change in the concentration of each substance affects the overall rate, and the overall order of a reaction is the sum of the orders for each substance present in the reaction. Reaction orders are typically first order, second order, or zero order, but fractional and even negative orders are possible.
