## Tables

### Table 1

**Summary:** This table has four columns and five rows. The first row is a header row and it labels each column, “Experiment,” “Initial Concentration [ N O ] ( mol / L ),” “Initial Concentration, [ H subscript 2 ] ( mol / L ),” and “Initial Rate of Formation of N subscript 2 ( mol / L min ).” Under the “Experiment” columns are the numbers: 1, 2, 3, and 4. Under the “Initial Concentration [ N O ] ( mol / L )” column are the numbers: 0.0060, 0.0060, 0.0010, and 0.0020. Under the “Initial Concentration, [ H subscript 2 ] ( mol / L )” column are the numbers: 0.0010, 0.0020, 0.0060, 0.0060. Under the “Initial Rate of Formation of N subscript 2 ( mol / L min )” are the numbers: 1.8 times ten to the negative 4; 3.6 times ten to the negative 4; 0.30 times ten to the negative 4; and 1.2 times ten to the negative 4.

## Figures

### CNX_Chem_12_06_BimoElRe

**Caption:** The probable mechanism for the reaction between NO~2~ and CO to yield NO and CO~2~.

**Alt text:** This figure provides an illustration of a reaction between two H I molecules using space filling models. H atoms are shown as white spheres, and I atoms are shown as purple spheres. On the left, two H I molecules are shownwith a small white sphere bonded to a much larger purple sphere. The label, “Two H I molecules,” appears below. An arrow points right to a similar structure in which the two molecules appear pushed together, so that the purple spheres of the two molecules are touching. Below appears the label, “Transition state.” Following another arrow, two white spheres are shown vertically oriented and bonded together with the label, “H subscript 2” above. The H subscript 2 molecule is followed by a plus sign and two purple spheres bonded together with the label, “I subscript 2” above. Below these structures is the label, “Hydrogen iodide molecules decompose to produce hydrogen H subscript 2 and iodine I subscript 2.”

### CNX_Chem_12_06_Cattle

**Caption:** A cattle chute is a nonchemical example of a rate-determining step. Cattle can only be moved from one holding pen to another as quickly as one animal can make its way through the chute. (credit: Loren Kerns)

**Alt text:** A photo is shown of cattle passing through a narrow chute into a holding pen. A person directs them through the gate with a long white and red pole.
