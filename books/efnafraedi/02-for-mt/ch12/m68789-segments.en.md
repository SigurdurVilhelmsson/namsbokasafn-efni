As described in the previous module, the rate of a reaction is often affected by the concentrations of reactants. __Rate laws__ (sometimes called *differential rate laws*) or __rate equations__ are mathematical expressions that describe the relationship between the rate of a chemical reaction and the concentration of its reactants. As an example, consider the reaction described by the chemical equation

{{SEG:m68789:para:fs-idm656673904}}
where *a* and *b* are stoichiometric coefficients. The rate law for this reaction is written as:

{{SEG:m68789:para:fs-idp18257184}}
in which [*A*] and [*B*] represent the molar concentrations of reactants, and *k* is the __rate constant__, which is specific for a particular reaction at a particular temperature. The exponents *m* and *n* are the __reaction orders__ and are typically positive integers, though they can be fractions, negative, or zero. The rate constant *k* and the reaction orders *m* and *n* must be determined experimentally by observing how the rate of a reaction changes as the concentrations of the reactants are changed. The rate constant *k* is independent of the reactant concentrations, but it does vary with temperature.

{{SEG:m68789:para:fs-idm115903376}}
The reaction orders in a rate law describe the mathematical dependence of the rate on reactant concentrations. Referring to the generic rate law above, the reaction is *m* order with respect to *A* and *n* order with respect to *B*. For example, if *m* = 1 and *n* = 2, the reaction is first order in *A* and second order in *B*. The __overall reaction order__ is simply the sum of orders for each reactant. For the example rate law here, the reaction is third order overall (1 + 2 = 3). A few specific examples are shown below to further illustrate this concept.

{{SEG:m68789:para:fs-idm217470464}}
The rate law:

{{SEG:m68789:para:fs-idm388320}}
describes a reaction that is first order in hydrogen peroxide and first order overall. The rate law:

{{SEG:m68789:para:fs-idm105991808}}
describes a reaction that is second order in C~4~H~6~ and second order overall. The rate law:

{{SEG:m68789:para:fs-idm221631328}}
describes a reaction that is first order in H^+^, first order in OH^−^, and second order overall.

Writing Rate Laws from Reaction Orders

{{SEG:m68789:para:fs-idm114205984}}
An experiment shows that the reaction of nitrogen dioxide with carbon monoxide:

{{SEG:m68789:para:fs-idm213018368}}
is second order in NO~2~ and zero order in CO at 100 °C. What is the rate law for the reaction?

{{SEG:m68789:para-title:fs-idm222185424-title}}
Solution

{{SEG:m68789:para:fs-idm222185424}}
The reaction will have the form:

{{SEG:m68789:para:fs-idm221521296}}
The reaction is second order in NO~2~; thus *m* = 2. The reaction is zero order in CO; thus *n* = 0. The rate law is:

{{SEG:m68789:para:fs-idm250199824}}
Remember that a number raised to the zero power is equal to 1, thus [CO]^0^ = 1, which is why the CO concentration term may be omitted from the rate law: the rate of reaction is solely dependent on the concentration of NO~2~. A later chapter section on reaction mechanisms will explain how a reactant’s concentration can have no effect on a reaction rate despite being involved in the reaction.

A common experimental approach to the determination of rate laws is the __method of initial rates__. This method involves measuring reaction rates for multiple experimental trials carried out using different initial reactant concentrations. Comparing the measured rates for these trials permits determination of the reaction orders and, subsequently, the rate constant, which together are used to formulate a rate law. This approach is illustrated in the next two example exercises.

Ozone in the upper atmosphere is depleted when it reacts with nitrogen oxides.

*Determine the value of* m *from the data in which [NO] varies and [O~3~] is constant.* In the last three experiments, [NO] varies while [O~3~] remains constant. When [NO] doubles from trial 3 to 4, the rate doubles, and when [NO] triples from trial 3 to 5, the rate also triples. Thus, the rate is also directly proportional to [NO], and *m* in the rate law is equal to 1.

*Determine the value of* n *from data in which [O~3~] varies and [NO] is constant.* In the first three experiments, [NO] is constant and [O~3~] varies. The reaction rate changes in direct proportion to the change in [O~3~]. When [O~3~] doubles from trial 1 to 2, the rate doubles; when [O~3~] triples from trial 1 to 3, the rate increases also triples. Thus, the rate is directly proportional to [O~3~], and *n* is equal to 1.The rate law is thus: [[MATH:1]]
