Second-Order Reactions

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idm67735584}}
Following the same approach as used for first-order reactions, an equation relating the half-life of a second-order reaction to its rate constant and initial concentration may be derived from its integrated rate law:

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idp69132640}}
or

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idp8098000}}
Restrict *t* to *t*~1/2~

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idm25226832}}
define [*A*]*t* as one-half [*A*]~0~

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idm148624880}}
and then substitute into the integrated rate law and simplify:

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idm75571200}}
For a second-order reaction, [[MATH:28]] is inversely proportional to the concentration of the reactant, and the half-life increases as the reaction proceeds because the concentration of reactant decreases. Unlike with first-order reactions, the rate constant of a second-order reaction cannot be calculated directly from the half-life unless the initial concentration is known.

{{SEG:m68791:title:fs-idm130842880-title}}
Zero-Order Reactions

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idm187241520}}
As for other reaction orders, an equation for zero-order half-life may be derived from the integrated rate law:

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idp132272768}}
Restricting the time and concentrations to those defined by half-life: [[MATH:29]] and [[MATH:30]] Substituting these terms into the zero-order integrated rate law yields:

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idm115295344}}
As for all reaction orders, the half-life for a zero-order reaction is inversely proportional to its rate constant. However, the half-life of a zero-order reaction increases as the initial concentration increases.

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idm99562880}}
The __half-life of a reaction (*t*~1/2~)__ is the time required for one-half of a given amount of reactant to be consumed. In each succeeding half-life, half of the remaining concentration of the reactant is consumed. Using the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide ({{XREF:14}}) as an example, we find that during the first half-life (from 0.00 hours to 6.00 hours), the concentration of H~2~O~2~ decreases from 1.000 *M* to 0.500 *M*. During the second half-life (from 6.00 hours to 12.00 hours), it decreases from 0.500 *M* to 0.250 *M*; during the third half-life, it decreases from 0.250 *M* to 0.125 *M*. The concentration of H~2~O~2~ decreases by half during each successive period of 6.00 hours. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is a first-order reaction, and, as can be shown, the half-life of a first-order reaction is independent of the concentration of the reactant. However, half-lives of reactions with other orders depend on the concentrations of the reactants.

Key Concepts and Summary

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idm85329552}}
Integrated rate laws are mathematically derived from differential rate laws, and they describe the time dependence of reactant and product concentrations.

{{SEG:m68791:para:fs-idp258559744}}
The half-life of a reaction is the time required to decrease the amount of a given reactant by one-half. A reaction’s half-life varies with rate constant and, for some reaction orders, reactant concentration. The half-life of a zero-order reaction decreases as the initial concentration of the reactant in the reaction decreases. The half-life of a first-order reaction is independent of concentration, and the half-life of a second-order reaction decreases as the concentration increases.
