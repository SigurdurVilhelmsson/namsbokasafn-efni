Preceding sections of this chapter focused on the composition of substances: samples of matter that contain only one type of element or compound. However, mixtures—samples of matter containing two or more substances physically combined—are more commonly encountered in nature than are pure substances. Similar to a pure substance, the relative composition of a mixture plays an important role in determining its properties. The relative amount of oxygen in a planet’s atmosphere determines its ability to sustain aerobic life. The relative amounts of iron, carbon, nickel, and other elements in steel (a mixture known as an “alloy”) determine its physical strength and resistance to corrosion. The relative amount of the active ingredient in a medicine determines its effectiveness in achieving the desired pharmacological effect. The relative amount of sugar in a beverage determines its sweetness (see {{XREF:2}}). This section will describe one of the most common ways in which the relative compositions of mixtures may be quantified.

Solutions

{{SEG:m68703:para:fs-idm60561504}}
Solutions have previously been defined as homogeneous mixtures, meaning that the composition of the mixture (and therefore its properties) is uniform throughout its entire volume. Solutions occur frequently in nature and have also been implemented in many forms of manmade technology. A more thorough treatment of solution properties is provided in the chapter on solutions and colloids, but provided here is an introduction to some of the basic properties of solutions.

{{SEG:m68703:para:fs-idm635664}}
The relative amount of a given solution component is known as its __concentration__. Often, though not always, a solution contains one component with a concentration that is significantly greater than that of all other components. This component is called the __solvent__ and may be viewed as the medium in which the other components are dispersed, or __dissolved__. Solutions in which water is the solvent are, of course, very common on our planet. A solution in which water is the solvent is called an __aqueous solution__.

{{SEG:m68703:para:fs-idm64279024}}
A __solute__ is a component of a solution that is typically present at a much lower concentration than the solvent. Solute concentrations are often described with qualitative terms such as __dilute__ (of relatively low concentration) and __concentrated__ (of relatively high concentration).

{{SEG:m68703:para:fs-idm62212352}}
Concentrations may be quantitatively assessed using a wide variety of measurement units, each convenient for particular applications. __Molarity (*M*)__ is a useful concentration unit for many applications in chemistry. Molarity is defined as the number of moles of solute in exactly 1 liter (1 L) of the solution:

A 355-mL soft drink sample contains 0.133 mol of sucrose (table sugar). What is the molar concentration of sucrose in the beverage?

Solution

{{SEG:m68703:para:fs-idm60197152}}
Since the molar amount of solute and the volume of solution are both given, the molarity can be calculated using the definition of molarity. Per this definition, the solution volume must be converted from mL to L:

{{SEG:m68703:para:fs-idm75726960}}
When performing calculations stepwise, as in {{XREF:8}}, it is important to refrain from rounding any intermediate calculation results, which can lead to rounding errors in the final result. In {{XREF:9}}, the molar amount of NaCl computed in the first step, 1.325 mol, would be properly rounded to 1.32 mol if it were to be reported; however, although the last digit (5) is not significant, it must be retained as a guard digit in the intermediate calculation. If the guard digit had not been retained, the final calculation for the mass of NaCl would have been 77.1 g, a difference of 0.3 g.

{{SEG:m68703:para:fs-idm105202592}}
In addition to retaining a guard digit for intermediate calculations, rounding errors may also be avoided by performing computations in a single step (see {{XREF:10}}). This eliminates intermediate steps so that only the final result is rounded.

Dilution of Solutions

{{SEG:m68703:para:fs-idm134700400}}
__Dilution__ is the process whereby the concentration of a solution is lessened by the addition of solvent. For example, a glass of iced tea becomes increasingly diluted as the ice melts. The water from the melting ice increases the volume of the solvent (water) and the overall volume of the solution (iced tea), thereby reducing the relative concentrations of the solutes that give the beverage its taste ({{XREF:12}}).

Both solutions contain the same mass of copper nitrate. The solution on the right is more dilute because the copper nitrate is dissolved in more solvent. (credit: Mark Ott)

{{SEG:m68703:para:fs-idm77995840}}
Dilution is also a common means of preparing solutions of a desired concentration. By adding solvent to a measured portion of a more concentrated *stock solution*, a solution of lesser concentration may be prepared. For example, commercial pesticides are typically sold as solutions in which the active ingredients are far more concentrated than is appropriate for their application. Before they can be used on crops, the pesticides must be diluted. This is also a very common practice for the preparation of a number of common laboratory reagents.

{{SEG:m68703:para:fs-idm77996832}}
A simple mathematical relationship can be used to relate the volumes and concentrations of a solution before and after the dilution process. According to the definition of molarity, the number of moles of solute in a solution (*n*) is equal to the product of the solution’s molarity (*M*) and its volume in liters (*L*):

{{SEG:m68703:para:fs-idm104760288}}
Expressions like these may be written for a solution before and after it is diluted:

{{SEG:m68703:para:fs-idm123215808}}
where the subscripts “1” and “2” refer to the solution before and after the dilution, respectively. Since the dilution process *does not change the amount of solute in the solution, **n*~1~ = *n*~2~. Thus, these two equations may be set equal to one another:

{{SEG:m68703:para:fs-idm103311152}}
This relation is commonly referred to as the dilution equation. Although this equation uses molarity as the unit of concentration and liters as the unit of volume, other units of concentration and volume may be used as long as the units properly cancel per the factor-label method. Reflecting this versatility, the dilution equation is often written in the more general form:

{{SEG:m68703:para:fs-idm81143040}}
where *C* and *V* are concentration and volume, respectively.

If 0.850 L of a 5.00-*M* solution of copper nitrate, Cu(NO~3~)~2~, is diluted to a volume of 1.80 L by the addition of water, what is the molarity of the diluted solution?

{{SEG:m68703:para-title:fs-idm63250768-title}}
Solution

{{SEG:m68703:para:fs-idm63250768}}
The stock concentration, *C*~1~, and volume, *V*~1~, are provided as well as the volume of the diluted solution, *V*~2~. Rearrange the dilution equation to isolate the unknown property, the concentration of the diluted solution, *C*~2~:

{{SEG:m68703:para:fs-idm81759792}}
Since the stock solution is being diluted by more than two-fold (volume is increased from 0.85 L to 1.80 L), the diluted solution’s concentration is expected to be less than one-half 5 *M*. This ballpark estimate will be compared to the calculated result to check for any gross errors in computation (for example, such as an improper substitution of the given quantities). Substituting the given values for the terms on the right side of this equation yields:

{{SEG:m68703:para:fs-idm125598048}}

{{SEG:m68703:para:fs-idm61209504}}
Since the diluted concentration (0.12 *M*) is slightly more than one-fourth the original concentration (0.45 *M*), the volume of the diluted solution is expected to be roughly four times the original volume, or around 44 mL. Substituting the given values and solving for the unknown volume yields:

{{SEG:m68703:para:fs-idm80652096}}
The volume of the 0.12-*M* solution is 0.041 L (41 mL). The result is reasonable and compares well with the rough estimate.

{{SEG:m68703:para:fs-idm108418736}}
Since the concentration of the diluted solution 0.100 *M* is roughly one-sixteenth that of the stock solution (1.59 *M*), the volume of the stock solution is expected to be about one-sixteenth that of the diluted solution, or around 0.3 liters. Substituting the given values and solving for the unknown volume yields:

Thus, 0.314 L of the 1.59-*M* solution is needed to prepare the desired solution. This result is consistent with the rough estimate.

Key Concepts and Summary

{{SEG:m68703:para:fs-idm67554336}}
Solutions are homogeneous mixtures. Many solutions contain one component, called the solvent, in which other components, called solutes, are dissolved. An aqueous solution is one for which the solvent is water. The concentration of a solution is a measure of the relative amount of solute in a given amount of solution. Concentrations may be measured using various units, with one very useful unit being molarity, defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. The solute concentration of a solution may be decreased by adding solvent, a process referred to as dilution. The dilution equation is a simple relation between concentrations and volumes of a solution before and after dilution.
