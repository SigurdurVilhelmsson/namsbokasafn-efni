        <source>To maintain proper calcium levels, calcium cations are added to the water in the form of an ionic compound that also contains anions; thus, it is necessary to know both the relative amount of Ca<g id="1" ctype="x-sup">2+</g> in the compound and the volume of water in the pool in order to achieve the proper calcium level.</source>
