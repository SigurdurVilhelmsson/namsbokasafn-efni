Many argue that modern chemical science began when scientists started exploring the quantitative as well as the qualitative aspects of chemistry. For example, Dalton’s atomic theory was an attempt to explain the results of measurements that allowed him to calculate the relative masses of elements combined in various compounds. Understanding the relationship between the masses of atoms and the chemical formulas of compounds allows us to quantitatively describe the composition of substances.

Formula Mass for Covalent Substances

{{SEG:m68700:para:fs-idp128238864}}
For covalent substances, the formula represents the numbers and types of atoms composing a single molecule of the substance; therefore, the formula mass may be correctly referred to as a molecular mass. Consider chloroform (CHCl~3~), a covalent compound once used as a surgical anesthetic and now primarily used in the production of tetrafluoroethylene, the building block for the "anti-stick" polymer, Teflon. The molecular formula of chloroform indicates that a single molecule contains one carbon atom, one hydrogen atom, and three chlorine atoms. The average molecular mass of a chloroform molecule is therefore equal to the sum of the average atomic masses of these atoms. {{XREF:2}} outlines the calculations used to derive the molecular mass of chloroform, which is 119.37 amu.

{{SEG:m68700:caption:CNX_Chem_03_01_chloroform-caption}}
The average mass of a chloroform molecule, CHCl~3~, is 119.37 amu, which is the sum of the average atomic masses of each of its constituent atoms. The model shows the molecular structure of chloroform.

Likewise, the molecular mass of an aspirin molecule, C~9~H~8~O~4~, is the sum of the atomic masses of nine carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, and four oxygen atoms, which amounts to 180.15 amu ({{XREF:3}}).

Formula Mass for Ionic Compounds

{{SEG:m68700:para:fs-idp13429376}}
Ionic compounds are composed of discrete cations and anions combined in ratios to yield electrically neutral bulk matter. The formula mass for an ionic compound is calculated in the same way as the formula mass for covalent compounds: by summing the average atomic masses of all the atoms in the compound’s formula. Keep in mind, however, that the formula for an ionic compound does not represent the composition of a discrete molecule, so it may not correctly be referred to as the “molecular mass.”

{{SEG:m68700:para:fs-idm4173824}}
As an example, consider sodium chloride, NaCl, the chemical name for common table salt. Sodium chloride is an ionic compound composed of sodium cations, Na^+^, and chloride anions, Cl^−^, combined in a 1:1 ratio. The formula mass for this compound is computed as 58.44 amu (see {{XREF:4}}).

{{SEG:m68700:caption:CNX_Chem_03_01_saltMass-caption}}
Table salt, NaCl, contains an array of sodium and chloride ions combined in a 1:1 ratio. Its formula mass is 58.44 amu.

{{SEG:m68700:para:fs-idm31455504}}
Note that the average masses of neutral sodium and chlorine atoms were used in this computation, rather than the masses for sodium cations and chlorine anions. This approach is perfectly acceptable when computing the formula mass of an ionic compound. Even though a sodium cation has a slightly smaller mass than a sodium atom (since it is missing an electron), this difference will be offset by the fact that a chloride anion is slightly more massive than a chloride atom (due to the extra electron). Moreover, the mass of an electron is negligibly small with respect to the mass of a typical atom. Even when calculating the mass of an isolated ion, the missing or additional electrons can generally be ignored, since their contribution to the overall mass is negligible, reflected only in the nonsignificant digits that will be lost when the computed mass is properly rounded. The few exceptions to this guideline are very light ions derived from elements with precisely known atomic masses.

An earlier chapter of this text described the development of the atomic mass unit, the concept of average atomic masses, and the use of chemical formulas to represent the elemental makeup of substances. These ideas can be extended to calculate the __formula mass__ of a substance by summing the average atomic masses of all the atoms represented in the substance’s formula.

{{SEG:m68700:title:fs-idp3385536-title}}
The Mole

{{SEG:m68700:para:fs-idm38739232}}
The identity of a substance is defined not only by the types of atoms or ions it contains, but by the quantity of each type of atom or ion. For example, water, H~2~O, and hydrogen peroxide, H~2~O~2~, are alike in that their respective molecules are composed of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. However, because a hydrogen peroxide molecule contains two oxygen atoms, as opposed to the water molecule, which has only one, the two substances exhibit very different properties. Today, sophisticated instruments allow the direct measurement of these defining microscopic traits; however, the same traits were originally derived from the measurement of macroscopic properties (the masses and volumes of bulk quantities of matter) using relatively simple tools (balances and volumetric glassware). This experimental approach required the introduction of a new unit for amount of substances, the *mole*, which remains indispensable in modern chemical science.

{{SEG:m68700:para:fs-idp4269776}}
The *mole* is an amount unit similar to familiar units like pair, dozen, gross, etc. It provides a specific measure of *the number* of atoms or molecules in a sample of matter. One Latin connotation for the word “mole” is “large mass” or “bulk,” which is consistent with its use as the name for this unit. The mole provides a link between an easily measured macroscopic property, bulk mass, and an extremely important fundamental property, number of atoms, molecules, and so forth. A __mole__ of substance is that amount in which there are 6.02214076 [[MATH:1]] 10^23^ discrete entities (atoms or molecules). This large number is a fundamental constant known as __Avogadro’s number (*N~A~*)__ or the Avogadro constant in honor of Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro. This constant is properly reported with an explicit unit of “per mole,” a conveniently rounded version being 6.022 [[MATH:2]] 10^23^/mol.

{{SEG:m68700:para:fs-idm42768912}}
Consistent with its definition as an amount unit, 1 mole of any element contains the same number of atoms as 1 mole of any other element. The masses of 1 mole of different elements, however, are different, since the masses of the individual atoms are drastically different. The __molar mass__ of an element (or compound) is the mass in grams of 1 mole of that substance, a property expressed in units of grams per mole (g/mol) (see {{XREF:5}}).

{{SEG:m68700:para:fs-idm26436032}}
The molar mass of any substance is numerically equivalent to its atomic or formula weight in amu. Per the amu definition, a single ^12^C atom weighs 12 amu (its atomic mass is 12 amu). A mole of ^12^C weighs 12 g (its molar mass is 12 g/mol). This relationship holds for all elements, since their atomic masses are measured relative to that of the amu-reference substance, ^12^C. Extending this principle, the molar mass of a compound in grams is likewise numerically equivalent to its formula mass in amu ({{XREF:6}}).

While atomic mass and molar mass are numerically equivalent, keep in mind that they are vastly different in terms of scale, as represented by the vast difference in the magnitudes of their respective units (amu versus g). To appreciate the enormity of the mole, consider a small drop of water weighing about 0.03 g (see {{XREF:7}}). Although this represents just a tiny fraction of 1 mole of water (~18 g), it contains more water molecules than can be clearly imagined. If the molecules were distributed equally among the roughly seven billion people on earth, each person would receive more than 100 billion molecules.

According to nutritional guidelines from the US Department of Agriculture, the estimated average requirement for dietary potassium is 4.7 g. What is the estimated average requirement of potassium in moles?

Solution

{{SEG:m68700:para:fs-idm16014480}}
The mass of K is provided, and the corresponding amount of K in moles is requested. Referring to the periodic table, the atomic mass of K is 39.10 amu, and so its molar mass is 39.10 g/mol. The given mass of K (4.7 g) is a bit more than one-tenth the molar mass (39.10 g), so a reasonable “ballpark” estimate of the number of moles would be slightly greater than 0.1 mol.

A liter of air contains 9.2 [[MATH:11]] 10^−4^ mol argon. What is the mass of Ar in a liter of air?

{{SEG:m68700:para-title:fs-idm19496816-title}}
Solution

{{SEG:m68700:para:fs-idm19496816}}
The molar amount of Ar is provided and must be used to derive the corresponding mass in grams. Since the amount of Ar is less than 1 mole, the mass will be less than the mass of 1 mole of Ar, approximately 40 g. The molar amount in question is approximately one-one thousandth (~10^−3^) of a mole, and so the corresponding mass should be roughly one-one thousandth of the molar mass (~0.04 g):

{{SEG:m68700:para:fs-idm1982944}}
In this case, logic dictates (and the factor-label method supports) multiplying the provided amount (mol) by the molar mass (g/mol):

{{SEG:m68700:para:fs-idm31048000}}
The result is in agreement with our expectations, around 0.04 g Ar.

Copper is commonly used to fabricate electrical wire ({{XREF:8}}). How many copper atoms are in 5.00 g of copper wire?

{{SEG:m68700:para-title:fs-idm40043360-title}}
Solution

{{SEG:m68700:para:fs-idm40043360}}
The number of Cu atoms in the wire may be conveniently derived from its mass by a two-step computation: first calculating the molar amount of Cu, and then using Avogadro’s number (*N~A~*) to convert this molar amount to number of Cu atoms:

{{SEG:m68700:para:fs-idp18362672}}
Considering that the provided sample mass (5.00 g) is a little less than one-tenth the mass of 1 mole of Cu (~64 g), a reasonable estimate for the number of atoms in the sample would be on the order of one-tenth *N~A~*, or approximately 10^22^ Cu atoms. Carrying out the two-step computation yields:
