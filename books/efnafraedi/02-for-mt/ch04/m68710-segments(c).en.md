Using the oxidation number concept, an all-inclusive definition of redox reaction has been established. __Oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions__ are those in which one or more elements involved undergo a change in oxidation number. (While the vast majority of redox reactions involve changes in oxidation number for two or more elements, a few interesting exceptions to this rule do exist {{XREF:11}}.) Definitions for the complementary processes of this reaction class are correspondingly revised as shown here:

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm1410784}}
Returning to the reactions used to introduce this topic, they may now both be identified as redox processes. In the reaction between sodium and chlorine to yield sodium chloride, sodium is oxidized (its oxidation number increases from 0 in Na to +1 in NaCl) and chlorine is reduced (its oxidation number decreases from 0 in Cl~2~ to −1 in NaCl). In the reaction between molecular hydrogen and chlorine, hydrogen is oxidized (its oxidation number increases from 0 in H~2~ to +1 in HCl) and chlorine is reduced (its oxidation number decreases from 0 in Cl~2~ to −1 in HCl).

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp112552240}}
Several subclasses of redox reactions are recognized, including __combustion reactions__ in which the reductant (also called a *fuel*) and oxidant (often, but not necessarily, molecular oxygen) react vigorously and produce significant amounts of heat, and often light, in the form of a flame. Solid rocket-fuel reactions such as the one depicted in {{XREF:12}} are combustion processes. A typical propellant reaction in which solid aluminum is oxidized by ammonium perchlorate is represented by this equation:

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm5712736}}
Watch a brief {{LINK:2}}video{{/LINK}} showing the test firing of a small-scale, prototype, hybrid rocket engine planned for use in the new Space Launch System being developed by NASA. The first engines firing at3 s (green flame) use a liquid fuel/oxidant mixture, and the second, more powerful engines firing at 4 s (yellow flame) use a solid mixture.

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm580304}}
__Single-displacement (replacement) reactions__ are redox reactions in which an ion in solution is displaced (or replaced) via the oxidation of a metallic element. One common example of this type of reaction is the acid oxidation of certain metals:

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm50858768}}
Metallic elements may also be oxidized by solutions of other metal salts; for example:

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm10678768}}
This reaction may be observed by placing copper wire in a solution containing a dissolved silver salt. Silver ions in solution are reduced to elemental silver at the surface of the copper wire, and the resulting Cu^2+^ ions dissolve in the solution to yield a characteristic blue color ({{XREF:13}}).

Redox reactions are identified per definition if one or more elements undergo a change in oxidation number.

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp31047840}}
(a) This is not a redox reaction, since oxidation numbers remain unchanged for all elements.

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp218627312}}
(b) This is a redox reaction. Gallium is oxidized, its oxidation number increasing from 0 in Ga(*l*) to +3 in GaBr~3~(*s*). The reducing agent is Ga(*l*). Bromine is reduced, its oxidation number decreasing from 0 in Br~2~(*l*) to −1 in GaBr~3~(*s*). The oxidizing agent is Br~2~(*l*).

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp223712368}}
(c) This is a redox reaction. It is a particularly interesting process, as it involves the same element, oxygen, undergoing both oxidation and reduction (a so-called *disproportionation reaction)*. Oxygen is oxidized, its oxidation number increasing from −1 in H~2~O~2~(*aq*) to 0 in O~2~(*g*). Oxygen is also reduced, its oxidation number decreasing from −1 in H~2~O~2~(*aq*) to −2 in H~2~O(*l*).

Key Concepts and Summary

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp62302320}}
Chemical reactions are classified according to similar patterns of behavior. A large number of important reactions are included in three categories: precipitation, acid-base, and oxidation-reduction (redox). Precipitation reactions involve the formation of one or more insoluble products. Acid-base reactions involve the transfer of hydrogen ions between reactants. Redox reactions involve a change in oxidation number for one or more reactant elements. Writing balanced equations for some redox reactions that occur in aqueous solutions is simplified by using a systematic approach called the half-reaction method.
