Humans interact with one another in various and complex ways, and we classify these interactions according to common patterns of behavior. When two humans exchange information, we say they are communicating. When they exchange blows with their fists or feet, we say they are fighting. Faced with a wide range of varied interactions between chemical substances, scientists have likewise found it convenient (or even necessary) to classify chemical interactions by identifying common patterns of reactivity. This module will provide an introduction to three of the most prevalent types of chemical reactions: precipitation, acid-base, and oxidation-reduction.

## Precipitation Reactions and Solubility Rules

A **precipitation reaction**{id="term-00001"} is one in which dissolved substances react to form one (or more) solid products. Many reactions of this type involve the exchange of ions between ionic compounds in aqueous solution and are sometimes referred to as *double displacement*, *double replacement*, or *metathesis* reactions. These reactions are common in nature and are responsible for the formation of coral reefs in ocean waters and kidney stones in animals. They are used widely in industry for production of a number of commodity and specialty chemicals. Precipitation reactions also play a central role in many chemical analysis techniques, including spot tests used to identify metal ions and *gravimetric methods* for determining the composition of matter (see the last module of this chapter).

The extent to which a substance may be dissolved in water, or any solvent, is quantitatively expressed as its **solubility**{id="term-00002"}, defined as the maximum concentration of a substance that can be achieved under specified conditions. Substances with relatively large solubilities are said to be **soluble**{id="term-00003"}. A substance will **precipitate**{id="term-00004"} when solution conditions are such that its concentration exceeds its solubility. Substances with relatively low solubilities are said to be **insoluble**{id="term-00005"}, and these are the substances that readily precipitate from solution. More information on these important concepts is provided in a later chapter on solutions. For purposes of predicting the identities of solids formed by precipitation reactions, one may simply refer to patterns of solubility that have been observed for many ionic compounds ([↗]{ref="fs-idp140132617697568"}).

A vivid example of precipitation is observed when solutions of potassium iodide and lead nitrate are mixed, resulting in the formation of solid lead iodide:

[[EQ:1]]{id="fs-idp98445312"}

This observation is consistent with the solubility guidelines: The only insoluble compound among all those involved is lead iodide, one of the exceptions to the general solubility of iodide salts.

The net ionic equation representing this reaction is:

[[EQ:2]]{id="fs-idp31365696"}

Lead iodide is a bright yellow solid that was formerly used as an artist’s pigment known as iodine yellow ([↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_04_02_LeadIodide"}). The properties of pure PbI~2~ crystals make them useful for fabrication of X-ray and gamma ray detectors.

The solubility guidelines in [↗]{ref="fs-idp140132617697568"} may be used to predict whether a precipitation reaction will occur when solutions of soluble ionic compounds are mixed together. One merely needs to identify all the ions present in the solution and then consider if possible cation/anion pairing could result in an insoluble compound. For example, mixing solutions of silver nitrate and sodium chloride will yield a solution containing Ag^+^, [[EQ:45]] Na^+^, and Cl^−^ ions. Aside from the two ionic compounds originally present in the solutions, AgNO~3~ and NaCl, two additional ionic compounds may be derived from this collection of ions: NaNO~3~ and AgCl. The solubility guidelines indicate all nitrate salts are soluble but that AgCl is one of insoluble. A precipitation reaction, therefore, is predicted to occur, as described by the following equations:

## Acid-Base Reactions

An **acid-base reaction**{id="term-00006"} is one in which a hydrogen ion, H^+^, is transferred from one chemical species to another. Such reactions are of central importance to numerous natural and technological processes, ranging from the chemical transformations that take place within cells and the lakes and oceans, to the industrial-scale production of fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and other substances essential to society. The subject of acid-base chemistry, therefore, is worthy of thorough discussion, and a full chapter is devoted to this topic later in the text.

For purposes of this brief introduction, we will consider only the more common types of acid-base reactions that take place in aqueous solutions. In this context, an **acid**{id="term-00007"} is a substance that will dissolve in water to yield hydronium ions, H~3~O^+^. As an example, consider the equation shown here:

[[EQ:7]]{id="fs-idm54028336"}

The process represented by this equation confirms that hydrogen chloride is an acid. When dissolved in water, H~3~O^+^ ions are produced by a chemical reaction in which H^+^ ions are transferred from HCl molecules to H~2~O molecules ([↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_04_02_HClsoln"}).

![](CNX_Chem_04_02_HClsoln.jpg){id="CNX_Chem_04_02_HClsoln" class="scaled-down" alt="This figure shows two flasks, labeled a and b. The flasks are both sealed with stoppers and are nearly three-quarters full of a liquid. Flask a is labeled H C l followed by g in parentheses. In the liquid there are approximately twenty space-filling molecular models composed of one red sphere and two smaller attached white spheres. The label H subscript 2 O followed by a q in parentheses is connected with a line to one of these models. In the space above the liquid in the flask, four space filling molecular models composed of one larger green sphere to which a smaller white sphere is bonded are shown. To one of these models, the label H C l followed by g in parentheses is attached with a line segment. An arrow is drawn from the space above the liquid pointing down into the liquid below. Flask b is labeled H subscript 3 O superscript positive sign followed by a q in parentheses. This is followed by a plus sign and C l superscript negative sign which is also followed by a q in parentheses. In this flask, no molecules are shown in the open space above the liquid. A label, C l superscript negative sign followed by a q in parentheses, is connected with a line segment to a green sphere. This sphere is surrounded by four molecules composed each of one red sphere and two white smaller spheres. A few of these same molecules appear separate from the green spheres in the liquid. A line segment connects one of them to the label H subscript 2 O which is followed by l in parentheses. There are a few molecules formed from one central larger red sphere to which three smaller white spheres are bonded. A line segment is drawn from one of these to the label H subscript 3 O superscript positive sign, followed by a q in parentheses."}

*Figure 4.2: When hydrogen chloride gas dissolves in water, (a) it reacts as an acid, transferring protons to water molecules to yield (b) hydronium ions (and solvated chloride ions).*{id="CNX_Chem_04_02_HClsoln"}

The nature of HCl is such that its reaction with water as just described is essentially 100% efficient: Virtually every HCl molecule that dissolves in water will undergo this reaction. Acids that completely react in this fashion are called **strong acids**{id="term-00008"}, and HCl is one among just a handful of common acid compounds that are classified as strong ([↗]{ref="fs-idp55395904"}). A far greater number of compounds behave as **weak acids**{id="term-00009"} and only partially react with water, leaving a large majority of dissolved molecules in their original form and generating a relatively small amount of hydronium ions. Weak acids are commonly encountered in nature, being the substances partly responsible for the tangy taste of citrus fruits, the stinging sensation of insect bites, and the unpleasant smells associated with body odor. A familiar example of a weak acid is acetic acid, the main ingredient in food vinegars:

[[EQ:8]]{id="fs-idp23273024"}

When dissolved in water under typical conditions, only about 1% of acetic acid molecules are present in the ionized form, [[EQ:46]] ([↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_04_02_Citrus"}). (The use of a double-arrow in the equation above denotes the partial reaction aspect of this process, a concept addressed fully in the chapters on chemical equilibrium.)

A **base**{id="term-00010"} is a substance that will dissolve in water to yield hydroxide ions, OH^−^. The most common bases are ionic compounds composed of alkali or alkaline earth metal cations (groups 1 and 2) combined with the hydroxide ion—for example, NaOH and Ca(OH)~2~. Unlike the acid compounds discussed previously, these compounds do not react chemically with water; instead they dissolve and dissociate, releasing hydroxide ions directly into the solution. For example, KOH and Ba(OH)~2~ dissolve in water and dissociate completely to produce cations (K^+^ and Ba^2+^, respectively) and hydroxide ions, OH^−^. These bases, along with other hydroxides that completely dissociate in water, are considered **strong bases**{id="term-00011"}.
