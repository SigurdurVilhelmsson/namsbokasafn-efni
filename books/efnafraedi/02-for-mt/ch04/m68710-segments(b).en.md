Our stomachs contain a solution of roughly 0.03 *M* HCl, which helps us digest the food we eat. The burning sensation associated with heartburn is a result of the acid of the stomach leaking through the muscular valve at the top of the stomach into the lower reaches of the esophagus. The lining of the esophagus is not protected from the corrosive effects of stomach acid the way the lining of the stomach is, and the results can be very painful. When we have heartburn, it feels better if we reduce the excess acid in the esophagus by taking an antacid. As you may have guessed, antacids are bases. One of the most common antacids is calcium carbonate, CaCO~3~. The reaction,

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp31618928}}
not only neutralizes stomach acid, it also produces CO~2~(*g*), which may result in a satisfying belch.

This reaction does not produce carbon dioxide, but magnesium-containing antacids can have a laxative effect. Several antacids have aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)~3~, as an active ingredient. The aluminum hydroxide tends to cause constipation, and some antacids use aluminum hydroxide in concert with magnesium hydroxide to balance the side effects of the two substances.

Culinary Aspects of Chemistry

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm118182736}}
Examples of acid-base chemistry are abundant in the culinary world. One example is the use of baking soda, or sodium bicarbonate in baking. NaHCO~3~ is a base. When it reacts with an acid such as lemon juice, buttermilk, or sour cream in a batter, bubbles of carbon dioxide gas are formed from decomposition of the resulting carbonic acid, and the batter “rises.” Baking powder is a combination of sodium bicarbonate, and one or more acid salts that react when the two chemicals come in contact with water in the batter.

Many people like to put lemon juice or vinegar, both of which are acids, on cooked fish ({{XREF:10}}). It turns out that fish have volatile amines (bases) in their systems, which are neutralized by the acids to yield involatile ammonium salts. This reduces the odor of the fish, and also adds a “sour” taste that we seem to enjoy.

Pickling is a method used to preserve vegetables using a naturally produced acidic environment. The vegetable, such as a cucumber, is placed in a sealed jar submerged in a brine solution. The brine solution favors the growth of beneficial bacteria and suppresses the growth of harmful bacteria. The beneficial bacteria feed on starches in the cucumber and produce lactic acid as a waste product in a process called fermentation. The lactic acid eventually increases the acidity of the brine to a level that kills any harmful bacteria, which require a basic environment. Without the harmful bacteria consuming the cucumbers they are able to last much longer than if they were unprotected. A byproduct of the pickling process changes the flavor of the vegetables with the acid making them taste sour.

Balancing Redox Reactions via the Half-Reaction Method

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm141853312}}
Redox reactions that take place in aqueous media often involve water, hydronium ions, and hydroxide ions as reactants or products. Although these species are not oxidized or reduced, they do participate in chemical change in other ways (e.g., by providing the elements required to form oxyanions). Equations representing these reactions are sometimes very difficult to balance by inspection, so systematic approaches have been developed to assist in the process. One very useful approach is to use the method of half-reactions, which involves the following steps:

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm64885712}}
1. Write the two half-reactions representing the redox process.

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm219773632}}
2. Balance all elements except oxygen and hydrogen.

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm339557376}}
3. Balance oxygen atoms by adding H~2~O molecules.

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm161858496}}
4. Balance hydrogen atoms by adding H^+^ ions.

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm218459968}}
5. Balance charge by adding electrons.

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm31626864}}
6. If necessary, multiply each half-reaction’s coefficients by the smallest possible integers to yield equal numbers of electrons in each.

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm241499680}}
7. Add the balanced half-reactions together and simplify by removing species that appear on both sides of the equation.

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm228573904}}
8. For reactions occurring in basic media (excess hydroxide ions), carry out these additional steps:

{{SEG:m68710:item:fs-idp48488192-item-1}}
Add OH^−^ ions to both sides of the equation in numbers equal to the number of H^+^ ions.

{{SEG:m68710:item:fs-idp48488192-item-2}}
On the side of the equation containing both H^+^ and OH^−^ ions, combine these ions to yield water molecules.

{{SEG:m68710:item:fs-idp48488192-item-3}}
Simplify the equation by removing any redundant water molecules.

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm268418480}}
9. Finally, check to see that both the number of atoms and the total charges [footnote: The requirement of “charge balance” is just a specific type of “mass balance” in which the species in question are electrons. An equation must represent equal numbers of electrons on the reactant and product sides, and so both atoms and charges must be balanced.] are balanced.

Earth’s atmosphere contains about 20% molecular oxygen, O~2~, a chemically reactive gas that plays an essential role in the metabolism of aerobic organisms and in many environmental processes that shape the world. The term __oxidation__ was originally used to describe chemical reactions involving O~2~, but its meaning has evolved to refer to a broad and important reaction class known as *oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions*. A few examples of such reactions will be used to develop a clear picture of this classification.

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm49954608}}
Some redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons between reactant entities to yield ionic products, such as the reaction between sodium and chlorine to yield sodium chloride:

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm102441680}}
It is helpful to view the process with regard to each individual reactant, that is, to represent the fate of each reactant in the form of an equation called a __half-reaction__:

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp97564400}}
These equations show that Na atoms *lose electrons* while Cl atoms (in the Cl~2~ molecule) *gain electrons*, the “*s*” subscripts for the resulting ions signifying they are present in the form of a solid ionic compound. For redox reactions of this sort, the loss and gain of electrons define the complementary processes that occur:

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp6686448}}
In this reaction, then, sodium is *oxidized* and chlorine undergoes __reduction__. Viewed from a more active perspective, sodium functions as a __reducing agent (reductant)__, since it provides electrons to (or reduces) chlorine. Likewise, chlorine functions as an __oxidizing agent (oxidant)__, as it effectively removes electrons from (oxidizes) sodium.

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp108466096}}
Some redox processes, however, do not involve the transfer of electrons. Consider, for example, a reaction similar to the one yielding NaCl:

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp168168224}}
The product of this reaction is a covalent compound, so transfer of electrons in the explicit sense is not involved. To clarify the similarity of this reaction to the previous one and permit an unambiguous definition of redox reactions, a property called *oxidation number* has been defined. The __oxidation number__ (or __oxidation state__) of an element in a compound is the charge its atoms would possess *if the compound were ionic*. The following guidelines are used to assign oxidation numbers to each element in a molecule or ion.

{{SEG:m68710:item:fs-idp29396208-item-1}}
The oxidation number of an atom in an elemental substance is zero.

{{SEG:m68710:item:fs-idp29396208-item-2}}
The oxidation number of a monatomic ion is equal to the ion’s charge.

{{SEG:m68710:item:fs-idp29396208-item-3}}
Oxidation numbers for common nonmetals are usually assigned as follows: Hydrogen: +1 when combined with nonmetals, −1 when combined with metals

{{SEG:m68710:item:fs-idp29396208-item-4}}
Oxygen: −2 in most compounds, sometimes −1 (so-called peroxides, [[MATH:39]] very rarely [[MATH:40]] (so-called superoxides, [[MATH:41]] positive values when combined with F (values vary)

{{SEG:m68710:item:fs-idp29396208-item-5}}
Halogens: −1 for F always, −1 for other halogens except when combined with oxygen or other halogens (positive oxidation numbers in these cases, varying values)

{{SEG:m68710:item:fs-idp29396208-item-6}}
The sum of oxidation numbers for all atoms in a molecule or polyatomic ion equals the charge on the molecule or ion.

{{SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm72440048}}
Note: The proper convention for reporting charge is to write the number first, followed by the sign (e.g., 2+), while oxidation number is written with the reversed sequence, sign followed by number (e.g., +2). This convention aims to emphasize the distinction between these two related properties.
