### CNX_Chem_04_05_titration

**Caption:** (a) A student fills a buret in preparation for a titration analysis. (b) A typical buret permits volume measurements to the nearest 0.01 mL. (credit a: modification of work by Mark Blaser and Matt Evans; credit b: modification of work by Mark Blaser and Matt Evans)

**Alt text:** Two pictures are shown. In a, a person is shown pouring a liquid from a small beaker into a buret. The person is wearing goggles and gloves as she transfers the solution into the buret. In b, a close up view of the markings on the side of the buret is shown. The markings for 10, 15, and 20 are clearly shown with horizontal rings printed on the buret. Between each of these whole number markings, half markings are also clearly shown with horizontal line segment markings.

### CNX_Chem_04_05_Filter

**Caption:** Precipitate may be removed from a reaction mixture by filtration.

**Alt text:** A photo is shown of a flask and funnel used for filtration. The flask contains a slightly opaque liquid filtrate with a slight yellow tint. A funnel, which contains a bright yellow and orange material, sits atop the flask. The flask is held in place by a clamp and is connected to a vacuum line. The connection between the funnel and flask is sealed with a rubber bung or gasket.

### CNX_Chem_04_05_combustion

**Caption:** This schematic diagram illustrates the basic components of a combustion analysis device for determining the carbon and hydrogen content of a sample.

**Alt text:** This diagram shows an arrow pointing from O subscript 2 into a tube that leads into a vessel containing a red material, labeled “Sample.” This vessel is inside a blue container with a red inner lining which is labeled “Furnace.” An arrow points from the tube to the right into the vessel above the red sample material. An arrow leads out of this vessel through a tube into a second vessel outside the furnace. An line points from this tube to a label above the diagram that reads “C O subscript 2, H subscript 2 O, O subscript 2, and other gases.” Many small green spheres are visible in the second vessel which is labeled below, “H subscript 2 O absorber such as M g ( C l O subscript 4 ) subscript 2.” An arrow points to the right through the vessel, and another arrow points right heading out of the vessel through a tube into a third vessel. The third vessel contains many small blue spheres. It is labeled “C O subscript 2 absorber such as N a O H.” An arrow points right through this vessel, and a final arrow points out of a tube at the right end of the vessel. Outside the end of this tube at the end of the arrow is the label, “O subscript 2 and other gases.”
