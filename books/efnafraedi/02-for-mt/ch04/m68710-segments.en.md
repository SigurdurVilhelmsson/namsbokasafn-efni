Humans interact with one another in various and complex ways, and we classify these interactions according to common patterns of behavior. When two humans exchange information, we say they are communicating. When they exchange blows with their fists or feet, we say they are fighting. Faced with a wide range of varied interactions between chemical substances, scientists have likewise found it convenient (or even necessary) to classify chemical interactions by identifying common patterns of reactivity. This module will provide an introduction to three of the most prevalent types of chemical reactions: precipitation, acid-base, and oxidation-reduction.

Precipitation Reactions and Solubility Rules

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp140132618169728 -->
A __precipitation reaction__ is one in which dissolved substances react to form one (or more) solid products. Many reactions of this type involve the exchange of ions between ionic compounds in aqueous solution and are sometimes referred to as *double displacement*, *double replacement*, or *metathesis* reactions. These reactions are common in nature and are responsible for the formation of coral reefs in ocean waters and kidney stones in animals. They are used widely in industry for production of a number of commodity and specialty chemicals. Precipitation reactions also play a central role in many chemical analysis techniques, including spot tests used to identify metal ions and *gravimetric methods* for determining the composition of matter (see the last module of this chapter).

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp140132617792992 -->
The extent to which a substance may be dissolved in water, or any solvent, is quantitatively expressed as its __solubility__, defined as the maximum concentration of a substance that can be achieved under specified conditions. Substances with relatively large solubilities are said to be __soluble__. A substance will __precipitate__ when solution conditions are such that its concentration exceeds its solubility. Substances with relatively low solubilities are said to be __insoluble__, and these are the substances that readily precipitate from solution. More information on these important concepts is provided in a later chapter on solutions. For purposes of predicting the identities of solids formed by precipitation reactions, one may simply refer to patterns of solubility that have been observed for many ionic compounds ([#fs-idp140132617697568]).

A vivid example of precipitation is observed when solutions of potassium iodide and lead nitrate are mixed, resulting in the formation of solid lead iodide:

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp24544224 -->
This observation is consistent with the solubility guidelines: The only insoluble compound among all those involved is lead iodide, one of the exceptions to the general solubility of iodide salts.

Lead iodide is a bright yellow solid that was formerly used as an artist’s pigment known as iodine yellow ([#CNX_Chem_04_02_LeadIodide]). The properties of pure PbI~2~ crystals make them useful for fabrication of X-ray and gamma ray detectors.

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp157312304 -->
The solubility guidelines in [#fs-idp140132617697568] may be used to predict whether a precipitation reaction will occur when solutions of soluble ionic compounds are mixed together. One merely needs to identify all the ions present in the solution and then consider if possible cation/anion pairing could result in an insoluble compound. For example, mixing solutions of silver nitrate and sodium chloride will yield a solution containing Ag^+^, [[MATH:1]] Na^+^, and Cl^−^ ions. Aside from the two ionic compounds originally present in the solutions, AgNO~3~ and NaCl, two additional ionic compounds may be derived from this collection of ions: NaNO~3~ and AgCl. The solubility guidelines indicate all nitrate salts are soluble but that AgCl is one of insoluble. A precipitation reaction, therefore, is predicted to occur, as described by the following equations:

Acid-Base Reactions

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm1255344 -->
An __acid-base reaction__ is one in which a hydrogen ion, H^+^, is transferred from one chemical species to another. Such reactions are of central importance to numerous natural and technological processes, ranging from the chemical transformations that take place within cells and the lakes and oceans, to the industrial-scale production of fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and other substances essential to society. The subject of acid-base chemistry, therefore, is worthy of thorough discussion, and a full chapter is devoted to this topic later in the text.

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp89436016 -->
For purposes of this brief introduction, we will consider only the more common types of acid-base reactions that take place in aqueous solutions. In this context, an __acid__ is a substance that will dissolve in water to yield hydronium ions, H~3~O^+^. As an example, consider the equation shown here:

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm10390992 -->
The process represented by this equation confirms that hydrogen chloride is an acid. When dissolved in water, H~3~O^+^ ions are produced by a chemical reaction in which H^+^ ions are transferred from HCl molecules to H~2~O molecules ([#CNX_Chem_04_02_HClsoln]).

<!-- SEG:m68710:caption:CNX_Chem_04_02_HClsoln-caption -->
When hydrogen chloride gas dissolves in water, (a) it reacts as an acid, transferring protons to water molecules to yield (b) hydronium ions (and solvated chloride ions).

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm57695504 -->
The nature of HCl is such that its reaction with water as just described is essentially 100% efficient: Virtually every HCl molecule that dissolves in water will undergo this reaction. Acids that completely react in this fashion are called __strong acids__, and HCl is one among just a handful of common acid compounds that are classified as strong ([#fs-idp55395904]). A far greater number of compounds behave as __weak acids__ and only partially react with water, leaving a large majority of dissolved molecules in their original form and generating a relatively small amount of hydronium ions. Weak acids are commonly encountered in nature, being the substances partly responsible for the tangy taste of citrus fruits, the stinging sensation of insect bites, and the unpleasant smells associated with body odor. A familiar example of a weak acid is acetic acid, the main ingredient in food vinegars:

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm23363712 -->
When dissolved in water under typical conditions, only about 1% of acetic acid molecules are present in the ionized form, [[MATH:2]] ([#CNX_Chem_04_02_Citrus]). (The use of a double-arrow in the equation above denotes the partial reaction aspect of this process, a concept addressed fully in the chapters on chemical equilibrium.)

A __base__ is a substance that will dissolve in water to yield hydroxide ions, OH^−^. The most common bases are ionic compounds composed of alkali or alkaline earth metal cations (groups 1 and 2) combined with the hydroxide ion—for example, NaOH and Ca(OH)~2~. Unlike the acid compounds discussed previously, these compounds do not react chemically with water; instead they dissolve and dissociate, releasing hydroxide ions directly into the solution. For example, KOH and Ba(OH)~2~ dissolve in water and dissociate completely to produce cations (K^+^ and Ba^2+^, respectively) and hydroxide ions, OH^−^. These bases, along with other hydroxides that completely dissociate in water, are considered __strong bases__.

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp74282160 -->
Consider as an example the dissolution of lye (sodium hydroxide) in water:

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp8724736 -->
This equation confirms that sodium hydroxide is a base. When dissolved in water, NaOH dissociates to yield Na^+^ and OH^−^ ions. This is also true for any other ionic compound containing hydroxide ions. Since the dissociation process is essentially complete when ionic compounds dissolve in water under typical conditions, NaOH and other ionic hydroxides are all classified as strong bases.

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm50199792 -->
Unlike ionic hydroxides, some compounds produce hydroxide ions when dissolved by chemically reacting with water molecules. In all cases, these compounds react only partially and so are classified as __weak bases__. These types of compounds are also abundant in nature and important commodities in various technologies. For example, global production of the weak base ammonia is typically well over 100 million metric tons annually, being widely used as an agricultural fertilizer, a raw material for chemical synthesis of other compounds, and an active ingredient in household cleaners ([#CNX_Chem_04_02_ammonia]). When dissolved in water, ammonia reacts partially to yield hydroxide ions, as shown here:

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm73811808 -->
This is, by definition, an acid-base reaction, in this case involving the transfer of H^+^ ions from water molecules to ammonia molecules. Under typical conditions, only about 1% of the dissolved ammonia is present as [[MATH:3]] ions.

(a) The two reactants are provided, HOCl and H~2~O. Since the substance is reported to be an acid, its reaction with water will involve the transfer of H^+^ from HOCl to H~2~O to generate hydronium ions, H~3~O^+^ and hypochlorite ions, OCl^−^.

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp73299936 -->

Stomach Antacids

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm55572160 -->
Our stomachs contain a solution of roughly 0.03 *M* HCl, which helps us digest the food we eat. The burning sensation associated with heartburn is a result of the acid of the stomach leaking through the muscular valve at the top of the stomach into the lower reaches of the esophagus. The lining of the esophagus is not protected from the corrosive effects of stomach acid the way the lining of the stomach is, and the results can be very painful. When we have heartburn, it feels better if we reduce the excess acid in the esophagus by taking an antacid. As you may have guessed, antacids are bases. One of the most common antacids is calcium carbonate, CaCO~3~. The reaction,

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp31618928 -->
not only neutralizes stomach acid, it also produces CO~2~(*g*), which may result in a satisfying belch.

This reaction does not produce carbon dioxide, but magnesium-containing antacids can have a laxative effect. Several antacids have aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)~3~, as an active ingredient. The aluminum hydroxide tends to cause constipation, and some antacids use aluminum hydroxide in concert with magnesium hydroxide to balance the side effects of the two substances.

Culinary Aspects of Chemistry

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm118182736 -->
Examples of acid-base chemistry are abundant in the culinary world. One example is the use of baking soda, or sodium bicarbonate in baking. NaHCO~3~ is a base. When it reacts with an acid such as lemon juice, buttermilk, or sour cream in a batter, bubbles of carbon dioxide gas are formed from decomposition of the resulting carbonic acid, and the batter “rises.” Baking powder is a combination of sodium bicarbonate, and one or more acid salts that react when the two chemicals come in contact with water in the batter.

Many people like to put lemon juice or vinegar, both of which are acids, on cooked fish ([#CNX_Chem_14_03_FishLemon]). It turns out that fish have volatile amines (bases) in their systems, which are neutralized by the acids to yield involatile ammonium salts. This reduces the odor of the fish, and also adds a “sour” taste that we seem to enjoy.

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm117278880 -->
Pickling is a method used to preserve vegetables using a naturally produced acidic environment. The vegetable, such as a cucumber, is placed in a sealed jar submerged in a brine solution. The brine solution favors the growth of beneficial bacteria and suppresses the growth of harmful bacteria. The beneficial bacteria feed on starches in the cucumber and produce lactic acid as a waste product in a process called fermentation. The lactic acid eventually increases the acidity of the brine to a level that kills any harmful bacteria, which require a basic environment. Without the harmful bacteria consuming the cucumbers they are able to last much longer than if they were unprotected. A byproduct of the pickling process changes the flavor of the vegetables with the acid making them taste sour.

Balancing Redox Reactions via the Half-Reaction Method

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm141853312 -->
Redox reactions that take place in aqueous media often involve water, hydronium ions, and hydroxide ions as reactants or products. Although these species are not oxidized or reduced, they do participate in chemical change in other ways (e.g., by providing the elements required to form oxyanions). Equations representing these reactions are sometimes very difficult to balance by inspection, so systematic approaches have been developed to assist in the process. One very useful approach is to use the method of half-reactions, which involves the following steps:

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm64885712 -->
1. Write the two half-reactions representing the redox process.

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm219773632 -->
2. Balance all elements except oxygen and hydrogen.

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm339557376 -->
3. Balance oxygen atoms by adding H~2~O molecules.

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm161858496 -->
4. Balance hydrogen atoms by adding H^+^ ions.

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm218459968 -->
5. Balance charge by adding electrons.

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm31626864 -->
6. If necessary, multiply each half-reaction’s coefficients by the smallest possible integers to yield equal numbers of electrons in each.

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm241499680 -->
7. Add the balanced half-reactions together and simplify by removing species that appear on both sides of the equation.

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm228573904 -->
8. For reactions occurring in basic media (excess hydroxide ions), carry out these additional steps:

<!-- SEG:m68710:item:fs-idp48488192-item-1 -->
Add OH^−^ ions to both sides of the equation in numbers equal to the number of H^+^ ions.

<!-- SEG:m68710:item:fs-idp48488192-item-2 -->
On the side of the equation containing both H^+^ and OH^−^ ions, combine these ions to yield water molecules.

<!-- SEG:m68710:item:fs-idp48488192-item-3 -->
Simplify the equation by removing any redundant water molecules.

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm268418480 -->
9. Finally, check to see that both the number of atoms and the total charges [footnote: The requirement of “charge balance” is just a specific type of “mass balance” in which the species in question are electrons. An equation must represent equal numbers of electrons on the reactant and product sides, and so both atoms and charges must be balanced.] are balanced.

Earth’s atmosphere contains about 20% molecular oxygen, O~2~, a chemically reactive gas that plays an essential role in the metabolism of aerobic organisms and in many environmental processes that shape the world. The term __oxidation__ was originally used to describe chemical reactions involving O~2~, but its meaning has evolved to refer to a broad and important reaction class known as *oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions*. A few examples of such reactions will be used to develop a clear picture of this classification.

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm49954608 -->
Some redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons between reactant entities to yield ionic products, such as the reaction between sodium and chlorine to yield sodium chloride:

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm102441680 -->
It is helpful to view the process with regard to each individual reactant, that is, to represent the fate of each reactant in the form of an equation called a __half-reaction__:

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp97564400 -->
These equations show that Na atoms *lose electrons* while Cl atoms (in the Cl~2~ molecule) *gain electrons*, the “*s*” subscripts for the resulting ions signifying they are present in the form of a solid ionic compound. For redox reactions of this sort, the loss and gain of electrons define the complementary processes that occur:

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp6686448 -->
In this reaction, then, sodium is *oxidized* and chlorine undergoes __reduction__. Viewed from a more active perspective, sodium functions as a __reducing agent (reductant)__, since it provides electrons to (or reduces) chlorine. Likewise, chlorine functions as an __oxidizing agent (oxidant)__, as it effectively removes electrons from (oxidizes) sodium.

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp108466096 -->
Some redox processes, however, do not involve the transfer of electrons. Consider, for example, a reaction similar to the one yielding NaCl:

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp168168224 -->
The product of this reaction is a covalent compound, so transfer of electrons in the explicit sense is not involved. To clarify the similarity of this reaction to the previous one and permit an unambiguous definition of redox reactions, a property called *oxidation number* has been defined. The __oxidation number__ (or __oxidation state__) of an element in a compound is the charge its atoms would possess *if the compound were ionic*. The following guidelines are used to assign oxidation numbers to each element in a molecule or ion.

<!-- SEG:m68710:item:fs-idp29396208-item-1 -->
The oxidation number of an atom in an elemental substance is zero.

<!-- SEG:m68710:item:fs-idp29396208-item-2 -->
The oxidation number of a monatomic ion is equal to the ion’s charge.

<!-- SEG:m68710:item:fs-idp29396208-item-3 -->
Oxidation numbers for common nonmetals are usually assigned as follows: Hydrogen: +1 when combined with nonmetals, −1 when combined with metals

<!-- SEG:m68710:item:fs-idp29396208-item-4 -->
Oxygen: −2 in most compounds, sometimes −1 (so-called peroxides, [[MATH:39]] very rarely [[MATH:40]] (so-called superoxides, [[MATH:41]] positive values when combined with F (values vary)

<!-- SEG:m68710:item:fs-idp29396208-item-5 -->
Halogens: −1 for F always, −1 for other halogens except when combined with oxygen or other halogens (positive oxidation numbers in these cases, varying values)

<!-- SEG:m68710:item:fs-idp29396208-item-6 -->
The sum of oxidation numbers for all atoms in a molecule or polyatomic ion equals the charge on the molecule or ion.

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm72440048 -->
Note: The proper convention for reporting charge is to write the number first, followed by the sign (e.g., 2+), while oxidation number is written with the reversed sequence, sign followed by number (e.g., +2). This convention aims to emphasize the distinction between these two related properties.

Using the oxidation number concept, an all-inclusive definition of redox reaction has been established. __Oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions__ are those in which one or more elements involved undergo a change in oxidation number. (While the vast majority of redox reactions involve changes in oxidation number for two or more elements, a few interesting exceptions to this rule do exist [#fs-idp180799104].) Definitions for the complementary processes of this reaction class are correspondingly revised as shown here:

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm1410784 -->
Returning to the reactions used to introduce this topic, they may now both be identified as redox processes. In the reaction between sodium and chlorine to yield sodium chloride, sodium is oxidized (its oxidation number increases from 0 in Na to +1 in NaCl) and chlorine is reduced (its oxidation number decreases from 0 in Cl~2~ to −1 in NaCl). In the reaction between molecular hydrogen and chlorine, hydrogen is oxidized (its oxidation number increases from 0 in H~2~ to +1 in HCl) and chlorine is reduced (its oxidation number decreases from 0 in Cl~2~ to −1 in HCl).

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp112552240 -->
Several subclasses of redox reactions are recognized, including __combustion reactions__ in which the reductant (also called a *fuel*) and oxidant (often, but not necessarily, molecular oxygen) react vigorously and produce significant amounts of heat, and often light, in the form of a flame. Solid rocket-fuel reactions such as the one depicted in [#CNX_Chem_04_00_Rocket] are combustion processes. A typical propellant reaction in which solid aluminum is oxidized by ammonium perchlorate is represented by this equation:

__Single-displacement (replacement) reactions__ are redox reactions in which an ion in solution is displaced (or replaced) via the oxidation of a metallic element. One common example of this type of reaction is the acid oxidation of certain metals:

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idm50858768 -->

This reaction may be observed by placing copper wire in a solution containing a dissolved silver salt. Silver ions in solution are reduced to elemental silver at the surface of the copper wire, and the resulting Cu^2+^ ions dissolve in the solution to yield a characteristic blue color ([#CNX_Chem_04_02_CuAgNO3]).

Key Concepts and Summary

<!-- SEG:m68710:para:fs-idp62302320 -->
Chemical reactions are classified according to similar patterns of behavior. A large number of important reactions are included in three categories: precipitation, acid-base, and oxidation-reduction (redox). Precipitation reactions involve the formation of one or more insoluble products. Acid-base reactions involve the transfer of hydrogen ions between reactants. Redox reactions involve a change in oxidation number for one or more reactant elements. Writing balanced equations for some redox reactions that occur in aqueous solutions is simplified by using a systematic approach called the half-reaction method.
