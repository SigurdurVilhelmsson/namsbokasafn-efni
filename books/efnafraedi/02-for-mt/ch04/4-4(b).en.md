Uranium can be isolated from its ores by dissolving it as UO~2~(NO~3~)~2~, then separating it as solid UO~2~(C~2~O~4~)·3H~2~O. Addition of 0.4031 g of sodium oxalate, Na~2~C~2~O~4~, to a solution containing 1.481 g of uranyl nitrate, UO~2~(NO~3~)~2~, yields 1.073 g of solid UO~2~(C~2~O~4~)·3H~2~O.

Na~2~C~2~O~4~ + UO~2~(NO~3~)~2~ + 3H~2~O ⟶ UO~2~(C~2~O~4~)·3H~2~O + 2NaNO~3~

Determine the limiting reactant and the percent yield of this reaction.

:::answer
Na~2~C~2~O~4~ is the limiting reactant. percent yield = 86.56%
