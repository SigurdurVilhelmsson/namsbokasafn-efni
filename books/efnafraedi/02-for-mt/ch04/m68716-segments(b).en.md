Potassium hydrogen phthalate, KHC~8~H~4~O~4~, or KHP, is used in many laboratories, including general chemistry laboratories, to standardize solutions of base. KHP is one of only a few stable solid acids that can be dried by warming and weighed. A 0.3420-g sample of KHC~8~H~4~O~4~ reacts with 35.73 mL of a NaOH solution in a titration. What is the molar concentration of the NaOH? [[MATH:15]]

The reaction of WCl~6~ with Al at ~400 °C gives black crystals of a compound containing only tungsten and chlorine. A sample of this compound, when reduced with hydrogen, gives 0.2232 g of tungsten metal and hydrogen chloride, which is absorbed in water. Titration of the hydrochloric acid thus produced requires 46.2 mL of 0.1051 *M* NaOH to reach the end point. What is the empirical formula of the black tungsten chloride?

{{SEG:m68716:solution:fs-idp66345312}}
The empirical formula is WCl~4~.
