Consider as an example the dissolution of lye (sodium hydroxide) in water:

[[EQ:9]]{id="fs-idm62931696"}

This equation confirms that sodium hydroxide is a base. When dissolved in water, NaOH dissociates to yield Na^+^ and OH^−^ ions. This is also true for any other ionic compound containing hydroxide ions. Since the dissociation process is essentially complete when ionic compounds dissolve in water under typical conditions, NaOH and other ionic hydroxides are all classified as strong bases.

Unlike ionic hydroxides, some compounds produce hydroxide ions when dissolved by chemically reacting with water molecules. In all cases, these compounds react only partially and so are classified as **weak bases**{id="term-00012"}. These types of compounds are also abundant in nature and important commodities in various technologies. For example, global production of the weak base ammonia is typically well over 100 million metric tons annually, being widely used as an agricultural fertilizer, a raw material for chemical synthesis of other compounds, and an active ingredient in household cleaners ([↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_04_02_ammonia"}). When dissolved in water, ammonia reacts partially to yield hydroxide ions, as shown here:

[[EQ:10]]{id="fs-idm9327664"}

This is, by definition, an acid-base reaction, in this case involving the transfer of H^+^ ions from water molecules to ammonia molecules. Under typical conditions, only about 1% of the dissolved ammonia is present as [[EQ:47]] ions.

A **neutralization reaction**{id="term-00013"} is a specific type of acid-base reaction in which the reactants are an acid and a base (but not water), and the products are often a **salt**{id="term-00014"} and water

[[EQ:11]]{id="fs-idm49357376"}

To illustrate a neutralization reaction, consider what happens when a typical antacid such as milk of magnesia (an aqueous suspension of solid Mg(OH)~2~) is ingested to ease symptoms associated with excess stomach acid (HCl):

[[EQ:12]]{id="fs-idm8492448"}

Note that in addition to water, this reaction produces a salt, magnesium chloride.

### Example 4.4: Writing Equations for Acid-Base Reactions

Write balanced chemical equations for the acid-base reactions described here:

(a) the weak acid hydrogen hypochlorite reacts with water

(b) a solution of barium hydroxide is neutralized with a solution of nitric acid

**Solution**

(a) The two reactants are provided, HOCl and H~2~O. Since the substance is reported to be an acid, its reaction with water will involve the transfer of H^+^ from HOCl to H~2~O to generate hydronium ions, H~3~O^+^ and hypochlorite ions, OCl^−^.

[[EQ:13]]{id="fs-idm141852368"}

A double-arrow is appropriate in this equation because it indicates the HOCl is a weak acid that has not reacted completely.

(b) The two reactants are provided, Ba(OH)~2~ and HNO~3~. Since this is a neutralization reaction, the two products will be water and a salt composed of the cation of the ionic hydroxide (Ba^2+^) and the anion generated when the acid transfers its hydrogen ion [[EQ:48]]

### Stomach Antacids

Our stomachs contain a solution of roughly 0.03 *M* HCl, which helps us digest the food we eat. The burning sensation associated with heartburn is a result of the acid of the stomach leaking through the muscular valve at the top of the stomach into the lower reaches of the esophagus. The lining of the esophagus is not protected from the corrosive effects of stomach acid the way the lining of the stomach is, and the results can be very painful. When we have heartburn, it feels better if we reduce the excess acid in the esophagus by taking an antacid. As you may have guessed, antacids are bases. One of the most common antacids is calcium carbonate, CaCO~3~. The reaction,

[[EQ:15]]{id="fs-idm156299504"}

not only neutralizes stomach acid, it also produces CO~2~(*g*), which may result in a satisfying belch.

Milk of Magnesia is a suspension of the sparingly soluble base magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)~2~. It works according to the reaction:

[[EQ:16]]{id="fs-idp1457888"}

The hydroxide ions generated in this equilibrium then go on to react with the hydronium ions from the stomach acid, so that:

[[EQ:17]]{id="fs-idp51950320"}

This reaction does not produce carbon dioxide, but magnesium-containing antacids can have a laxative effect. Several antacids have aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)~3~, as an active ingredient. The aluminum hydroxide tends to cause constipation, and some antacids use aluminum hydroxide in concert with magnesium hydroxide to balance the side effects of the two substances.

### Culinary Aspects of Chemistry

Examples of acid-base chemistry are abundant in the culinary world. One example is the use of baking soda, or sodium bicarbonate in baking. NaHCO~3~ is a base. When it reacts with an acid such as lemon juice, buttermilk, or sour cream in a batter, bubbles of carbon dioxide gas are formed from decomposition of the resulting carbonic acid, and the batter “rises.” Baking powder is a combination of sodium bicarbonate, and one or more acid salts that react when the two chemicals come in contact with water in the batter.

Many people like to put lemon juice or vinegar, both of which are acids, on cooked fish ([↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_14_03_FishLemon"}). It turns out that fish have volatile amines (bases) in their systems, which are neutralized by the acids to yield involatile ammonium salts. This reduces the odor of the fish, and also adds a “sour” taste that we seem to enjoy.

Pickling is a method used to preserve vegetables using a naturally produced acidic environment. The vegetable, such as a cucumber, is placed in a sealed jar submerged in a brine solution. The brine solution favors the growth of beneficial bacteria and suppresses the growth of harmful bacteria. The beneficial bacteria feed on starches in the cucumber and produce lactic acid as a waste product in a process called fermentation. The lactic acid eventually increases the acidity of the brine to a level that kills any harmful bacteria, which require a basic environment. Without the harmful bacteria consuming the cucumbers they are able to last much longer than if they were unprotected. A byproduct of the pickling process changes the flavor of the vegetables with the acid making them taste sour.

## Oxidation-Reduction Reactions

Earth’s atmosphere contains about 20% molecular oxygen, O~2~, a chemically reactive gas that plays an essential role in the metabolism of aerobic organisms and in many environmental processes that shape the world. The term **oxidation**{id="term-00015"} was originally used to describe chemical reactions involving O~2~, but its meaning has evolved to refer to a broad and important reaction class known as *oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions*. A few examples of such reactions will be used to develop a clear picture of this classification.

Some redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons between reactant entities to yield ionic products, such as the reaction between sodium and chlorine to yield sodium chloride:

[[EQ:18]]{id="fs-idm5657872"}

It is helpful to view the process with regard to each individual reactant, that is, to represent the fate of each reactant in the form of an equation called a **half-reaction**{id="term-00016"}:

[[EQ:19]]{id="fs-idp15924368"}

These equations show that Na atoms *lose electrons* while Cl atoms (in the Cl~2~ molecule) *gain electrons*, the “*s*” subscripts for the resulting ions signifying they are present in the form of a solid ionic compound. For redox reactions of this sort, the loss and gain of electrons define the complementary processes that occur:

[[EQ:20]]{id="fs-idp61672384"}

In this reaction, then, sodium is *oxidized* and chlorine undergoes **reduction**{id="term-00017"}. Viewed from a more active perspective, sodium functions as a **reducing agent (reductant)**{id="term-00018"}, since it provides electrons to (or reduces) chlorine. Likewise, chlorine functions as an **oxidizing agent (oxidant)**{id="term-00019"}, as it effectively removes electrons from (oxidizes) sodium.

[[EQ:21]]{id="fs-idm29833328"}

Some redox processes, however, do not involve the transfer of electrons. Consider, for example, a reaction similar to the one yielding NaCl:

[[EQ:22]]{id="fs-idp37282464"}

The product of this reaction is a covalent compound, so transfer of electrons in the explicit sense is not involved. To clarify the similarity of this reaction to the previous one and permit an unambiguous definition of redox reactions, a property called *oxidation number* has been defined. The **oxidation number**{id="term-00020"} (or **oxidation state**{id="term-00021"}) of an element in a compound is the charge its atoms would possess *if the compound were ionic*. The following guidelines are used to assign oxidation numbers to each element in a molecule or ion.

Note: The proper convention for reporting charge is to write the number first, followed by the sign (e.g., 2+), while oxidation number is written with the reversed sequence, sign followed by number (e.g., +2). This convention aims to emphasize the distinction between these two related properties.

### Example 4.5: Assigning Oxidation Numbers

Follow the guidelines in this section of the text to assign oxidation numbers to all the elements in the following species:

(a) H~2~S

(b) [[EQ:53]]

(c) Na~2~SO~4~

**Solution**

(a) According to guideline 3, the oxidation number for H is +1.

Using this oxidation number and the compound’s formula, guideline 4 may then be used to calculate the oxidation number for sulfur:

[[EQ:23]]{id="fs-idm58489232"}

(b) Guideline 3 suggests the oxidation number for oxygen is −2.

Using this oxidation number and the ion’s formula, guideline 4 may then be used to calculate the oxidation number for sulfur:

[[EQ:24]]{id="fs-idm22135232"}

(c) For ionic compounds, it’s convenient to assign oxidation numbers for the cation and anion separately.

According to guideline 2, the oxidation number for sodium is +1.

Assuming the usual oxidation number for oxygen (−2 per guideline 3), the oxidation number for sulfur is calculated as directed by guideline 4:

Using the oxidation number concept, an all-inclusive definition of redox reaction has been established. **Oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions**{id="term-00022"} are those in which one or more elements involved undergo a change in oxidation number. (While the vast majority of redox reactions involve changes in oxidation number for two or more elements, a few interesting exceptions to this rule do exist [↗]{ref="fs-idp180799104"}.) Definitions for the complementary processes of this reaction class are correspondingly revised as shown here:

[[EQ:26]]{id="fs-idp231200304"}

Returning to the reactions used to introduce this topic, they may now both be identified as redox processes. In the reaction between sodium and chlorine to yield sodium chloride, sodium is oxidized (its oxidation number increases from 0 in Na to +1 in NaCl) and chlorine is reduced (its oxidation number decreases from 0 in Cl~2~ to −1 in NaCl). In the reaction between molecular hydrogen and chlorine, hydrogen is oxidized (its oxidation number increases from 0 in H~2~ to +1 in HCl) and chlorine is reduced (its oxidation number decreases from 0 in Cl~2~ to −1 in HCl).

Several subclasses of redox reactions are recognized, including **combustion reactions**{id="term-00023"} in which the reductant (also called a *fuel*) and oxidant (often, but not necessarily, molecular oxygen) react vigorously and produce significant amounts of heat, and often light, in the form of a flame. Solid rocket-fuel reactions such as the one depicted in [↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_04_00_Rocket"} are combustion processes. A typical propellant reaction in which solid aluminum is oxidized by ammonium perchlorate is represented by this equation:

**Single-displacement (replacement) reactions**{id="term-00024"} are redox reactions in which an ion in solution is displaced (or replaced) via the oxidation of a metallic element. One common example of this type of reaction is the acid oxidation of certain metals:

[[EQ:28]]{id="fs-idp4619296"}

Metallic elements may also be oxidized by solutions of other metal salts; for example:

[[EQ:29]]{id="fs-idm10324592"}

This reaction may be observed by placing copper wire in a solution containing a dissolved silver salt. Silver ions in solution are reduced to elemental silver at the surface of the copper wire, and the resulting Cu^2+^ ions dissolve in the solution to yield a characteristic blue color ([↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_04_02_CuAgNO3"}).

### Example 4.6: Describing Redox Reactions

Identify which equations represent redox reactions, providing a name for the reaction if appropriate. For those reactions identified as redox, name the oxidant and reductant.

(a) [[EQ:56]]

(b) [[EQ:57]]

(c) [[EQ:58]]

(d) [[EQ:59]]

(e) [[EQ:60]]

**Solution**

Redox reactions are identified per definition if one or more elements undergo a change in oxidation number.

(a) This is not a redox reaction, since oxidation numbers remain unchanged for all elements.

(b) This is a redox reaction. Gallium is oxidized, its oxidation number increasing from 0 in Ga(*l*) to +3 in GaBr~3~(*s*). The reducing agent is Ga(*l*). Bromine is reduced, its oxidation number decreasing from 0 in Br~2~(*l*) to −1 in GaBr~3~(*s*). The oxidizing agent is Br~2~(*l*).

(c) This is a redox reaction. It is a particularly interesting process, as it involves the same element, oxygen, undergoing both oxidation and reduction (a so-called *disproportionation reaction)*. Oxygen is oxidized, its oxidation number increasing from −1 in H~2~O~2~(*aq*) to 0 in O~2~(*g*). Oxygen is also reduced, its oxidation number decreasing from −1 in H~2~O~2~(*aq*) to −2 in H~2~O(*l*). For disproportionation reactions, the same substance functions as an oxidant and a reductant.

(d) This is not a redox reaction, since oxidation numbers remain unchanged for all elements.

(e) This is a redox reaction (combustion). Carbon is oxidized, its oxidation number increasing from −2 in C~2~H~4~(*g*) to +4 in CO~2~(*g*). The reducing agent (fuel) is C~2~H~4~(*g*). Oxygen is reduced, its oxidation number decreasing from 0 in O~2~(*g*) to −2 in H~2~O(*l*). The oxidizing agent is O~2~(*g*).
