If the 3.21 g of NH~4~NO~3~ in [↗]{ref="fs-idp325184"} were dissolved in 100.0 g of water under the same conditions, how much would the temperature change? Explain your answer.

:::answer
22.6. Since the mass and the heat capacity of the solution is approximately equal to that of the water, the two-fold increase in the amount of water leads to a two-fold decrease of the temperature change.

One method of generating electricity is by burning coal to heat water, which produces steam that drives an electric generator. To determine the rate at which coal is to be fed into the burner in this type of plant, the heat of combustion per ton of coal must be determined using a bomb calorimeter. When 1.00 g of coal is burned in a bomb calorimeter ([↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_05_02_BombCalor"}), the temperature increases by 1.48 °C. If the heat capacity of the calorimeter is 21.6 kJ/°C, determine the heat produced by combustion of a ton of coal (2.000 [[EQ:29]] 10^3^ pounds).
