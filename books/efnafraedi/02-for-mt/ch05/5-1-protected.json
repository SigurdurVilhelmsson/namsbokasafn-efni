      "summary": "A table with three columns and seventeen rows is shown. The top row is the header row and contains the headers “Substance,” “State and Symbol,” and “Specific Heat (J / g ° C)”. Under the first heading are the terms “helium,” “water,” “ethanol,” “ice,” “water vapor,” “nitrogen,” “air,” “oxygen,” “aluminum,” “carbon dioxide,” “argon,” “iron,” “copper,” “lead,” “gold” and “silicon.” The second column contains the symbols and signs: “H e (g),” “H subscript 2 O (l),” “C subscript 2 H subscript 6 O (l),” “H subscript 2 O (s),” “H subscript 2 O (g),” “N subscript 2 (g),” a blank entry for air, “O subscript 2 (g),” “A l (s),” “C O subscript 2 (g),” “A r (g),” “F e (s),” “C u (s),” “P b (s),” “A u (s),” and “S I (s).” The last column contains the values “5.193,” “4.184,” “2.376,” “2.093 (at –10 °C), ” “1.864,” “1.040,” “1.007,” “0.918.” “0.897,” “0.853,” “0.522,” “0.449,” “0.385,” “0.130,” “0.129,” and “0.712.”"
