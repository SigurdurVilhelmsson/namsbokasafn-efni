The enthalpy changes for many types of chemical and physical processes are available in the reference literature, including those for combustion reactions, phase transitions, and formation reactions. As we discuss these quantities, it is important to pay attention to the *extensive* nature of enthalpy and enthalpy changes. Since the enthalpy change for a given reaction is proportional to the amounts of substances involved, it may be reported on that basis (i.e., as the Δ*H* for specific amounts of reactants). However, we often find it more useful to divide one extensive property (Δ*H*) by another (amount of substance), and report a per-amount *intensive* value of Δ*H*, often “normalized” to a per-mole basis. (Note that this is similar to determining the intensive property specific heat from the extensive property heat capacity, as seen previously.)

Standard Enthalpy of Combustion

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp8281184}}
__Standard enthalpy of combustion__ [[MATH:9]] is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of a substance burns (combines vigorously with oxygen) under standard state conditions; it is sometimes called “heat of combustion.” For example, the enthalpy of combustion of ethanol, −1366.8 kJ/mol, is the amount of heat produced when one mole of ethanol undergoes complete combustion at 25 °C and 1 atmosphere pressure, yielding products also at 25 °C and 1 atm.

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idm75327968}}
Enthalpies of combustion for many substances have been measured; a few of these are listed in {{XREF:6}}. Many readily available substances with large enthalpies of combustion are used as fuels, including hydrogen, carbon (as coal or charcoal), and __hydrocarbons__ (compounds containing only hydrogen and carbon), such as methane, propane, and the major components of gasoline.

Using Enthalpy of Combustion

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp186633648}}
As {{XREF:7}} suggests, the combustion of gasoline is a highly exothermic process. Let us determine the approximate amount of heat produced by burning 1.00 L of gasoline, assuming the enthalpy of combustion of gasoline is the same as that of isooctane, a common component of gasoline. The density of isooctane is 0.692 g/mL.

{{SEG:m68727:para-title:fs-idp177773984-title}}
Solution

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp177773984}}
Starting with a known amount (1.00 L of isooctane), we can perform conversions between units until we arrive at the desired amount of heat or energy. The enthalpy of combustion of isooctane provides one of the necessary conversions. {{XREF:8}} gives this value as −5460 kJ per 1 mole of isooctane (C~8~H~18~).

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp6149360}}
Using these data,

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp145151008}}
The combustion of 1.00 L of isooctane produces 33,100 kJ of heat. (This amount of energy is enough to melt 99.2 kg, or about 218 lbs, of ice.)

Emerging Algae-Based Energy Technologies (Biofuels)

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp90130976}}
As reserves of fossil fuels diminish and become more costly to extract, the search is ongoing for replacement fuel sources for the future. Among the most promising biofuels are those derived from algae ({{XREF:9}}). The species of algae used are nontoxic, biodegradable, and among the world’s fastest growing organisms. About 50% of algal weight is oil, which can be readily converted into fuel such as biodiesel. Algae can yield 26,000 gallons of __biofuel__ per hectare—much more energy per acre than other crops. Some strains of algae can flourish in brackish water that is not usable for growing other crops. Algae can produce biodiesel, biogasoline, ethanol, butanol, methane, and even jet fuel.

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp157750544}}
According to the US Department of Energy, only 39,000 square kilometers (about 0.4% of the land mass of the US or less than [[MATH:24]] of the area used to grow corn) can produce enough algal fuel to replace all the petroleum-based fuel used in the US. The cost of algal fuels is becoming more competitive—for instance, the US Air Force is producing jet fuel from algae at a total cost of under $5 per gallon. [footnote: For more on algal fuel, see http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/13/algae-solve-pentagon-fuel-problem.] The process used to produce algal fuel is as follows: grow the algae (which use sunlight as their energy source and CO~2~ as a raw material); harvest the algae; extract the fuel compounds (or precursor compounds); process as necessary (e.g., perform a transesterification reaction to make biodiesel); purify; and distribute ({{XREF:10}}).

Standard Enthalpy of Formation

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp93922992}}
A __standard enthalpy of formation [[MATH:25]]__ is an enthalpy change for a reaction in which exactly 1 mole of a pure substance is formed from free elements in their most stable states under standard state conditions. These values are especially useful for computing or predicting enthalpy changes for chemical reactions that are impractical or dangerous to carry out, or for processes for which it is difficult to make measurements. If we have values for the appropriate standard enthalpies of formation, we can determine the enthalpy change for any reaction, which we will practice in the next section on Hess’s law.

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp185900096}}
The standard enthalpy of formation of CO~2~(*g*) is −393.5 kJ/mol. This is the enthalpy change for the exothermic reaction:

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp165684992}}
starting with the reactants at a pressure of 1 atm and 25 °C (with the carbon present as graphite, the most stable form of carbon under these conditions) and ending with one mole of CO~2~, also at 1 atm and 25 °C. For nitrogen dioxide, NO~2~(*g*), [[MATH:26]] is 33.2 kJ/mol. This is the enthalpy change for the reaction:

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp173428336}}
A reaction equation with [[MATH:27]] mole of N~2~ and 1 mole of O~2~ is correct in this case because the standard enthalpy of formation always refers to 1 mole of product, NO~2~(*g*).

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp173432432}}
You will find a table of standard enthalpies of formation of many common substances in Appendix G. These values indicate that formation reactions range from highly exothermic (such as −2984 kJ/mol for the formation of P~4~O~10~) to strongly endothermic (such as +226.7 kJ/mol for the formation of acetylene, C~2~H~2~). By definition, the standard enthalpy of formation of an element in its most stable form is equal to zero under standard conditions, which is 1 atm for gases and 1 M for solutions.

Hess’s Law

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp218912624}}
There are two ways to determine the amount of heat involved in a chemical change: measure it experimentally, or calculate it from other experimentally determined enthalpy changes. Some reactions are difficult, if not impossible, to investigate and make accurate measurements for experimentally. And even when a reaction is not hard to perform or measure, it is convenient to be able to determine the heat involved in a reaction without having to perform an experiment.

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp177508528}}
This type of calculation usually involves the use of __Hess’s law__, which states: *If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise processes, the enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes of the various steps*. Hess’s law is valid because enthalpy is a state function: Enthalpy changes depend only on where a chemical process starts and ends, but not on the path it takes from start to finish. For example, we can think of the reaction of carbon with oxygen to form carbon dioxide as occurring either directly or by a two-step process. The direct process is written:

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp51924752}}
In the two-step process, first carbon monoxide is formed:

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp161438416}}
Then, carbon monoxide reacts further to form carbon dioxide:

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp186572000}}
The equation describing the overall reaction is the sum of these two chemical changes:

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp40118928}}
Because the CO produced in Step 1 is consumed in Step 2, the net change is:

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp128370320}}
According to Hess’s law, the enthalpy change of the reaction will equal the sum of the enthalpy changes of the steps.

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp10365136}}
The result is shown in {{XREF:11}}. We see that Δ*H* of the overall reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or two. This finding (overall Δ*H* for the reaction = sum of Δ*H* values for reaction “steps” in the overall reaction) is true in general for chemical and physical processes.

{{SEG:m68727:caption:CNX_Chem_05_03_HessCO2-caption}}
The formation of CO~2~(*g*) from its elements can be thought of as occurring in two steps, which sum to the overall reaction, as described by Hess’s law. The horizontal blue lines represent enthalpies. For an exothermic process, the products are at lower enthalpy than are the reactants.

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp167197264}}
Before we further practice using Hess’s law, let us recall two important features of Δ*H*.

{{SEG:m68727:item:fs-idp167198464-item-1}}
Δ*H* is directly proportional to the quantities of reactants or products. For example, the enthalpy change for the reaction forming 1 mole of NO~2~(*g*) is +33.2 kJ: [[MATH:44]] When 2 moles of NO~2~ (twice as much) are formed, the Δ*H* will be twice as large: [[MATH:45]] In general, if we multiply or divide an equation by a number, then the enthalpy change should also be multiplied or divided by the same number.

{{SEG:m68727:item:fs-idp167198464-item-2}}
Δ*H* for a reaction in one direction is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to Δ*H* for the reaction in the reverse direction. For example, given that: [[MATH:46]] Then, for the “reverse” reaction, the enthalpy change is also “reversed”: [[MATH:47]]

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp167199328}}
Δ*H* is directly proportional to the quantities of reactants or products. For example, the enthalpy change for the reaction forming 1 mole of NO~2~(*g*) is +33.2 kJ:
