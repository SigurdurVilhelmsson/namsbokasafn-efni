Using Enthalpy of Combustion

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp186633648}}
As [#CNX_Chem_05_03_GasBurning] suggests, the combustion of gasoline is a highly exothermic process. Let us determine the approximate amount of heat produced by burning 1.00 L of gasoline, assuming the enthalpy of combustion of gasoline is the same as that of isooctane, a common component of gasoline. The density of isooctane is 0.692 g/mL.

Solution

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp177773984}}
Starting with a known amount (1.00 L of isooctane), we can perform conversions between units until we arrive at the desired amount of heat or energy. The enthalpy of combustion of isooctane provides one of the necessary conversions. [#fs-idp98710048] gives this value as −5460 kJ per 1 mole of isooctane (C~8~H~18~).

Using these data,

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp145151008}}
The combustion of 1.00 L of isooctane produces 33,100 kJ of heat. (This amount of energy is enough to melt 99.2 kg, or about 218 lbs, of ice.)

Emerging Algae-Based Energy Technologies (Biofuels)

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp90130976}}
As reserves of fossil fuels diminish and become more costly to extract, the search is ongoing for replacement fuel sources for the future. Among the most promising biofuels are those derived from algae ([#CNX_Chem_05_03_AlgalFuel1]). The species of algae used are nontoxic, biodegradable, and among the world’s fastest growing organisms. About 50% of algal weight is oil, which can be readily converted into fuel such as biodiesel. Algae can yield 26,000 gallons of __biofuel__ per hectare—much more energy per acre than other crops. Some strains of algae can flourish in brackish water that is not usable for growing other crops. Algae can produce biodiesel, biogasoline, ethanol, butanol, methane, and even jet fuel.
