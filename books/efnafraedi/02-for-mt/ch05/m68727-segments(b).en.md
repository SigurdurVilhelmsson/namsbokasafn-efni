According to the US Department of Energy, only 39,000 square kilometers (about 0.4% of the land mass of the US or less than [[MATH:24]] of the area used to grow corn) can produce enough algal fuel to replace all the petroleum-based fuel used in the US. The cost of algal fuels is becoming more competitive—for instance, the US Air Force is producing jet fuel from algae at a total cost of under $5 per gallon. [footnote: For more on algal fuel, see http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/13/algae-solve-pentagon-fuel-problem.] The process used to produce algal fuel is as follows: grow the algae (which use sunlight as their energy source and CO~2~ as a raw material); harvest the algae; extract the fuel compounds (or precursor compounds); process as necessary (e.g., perform a transesterification reaction to make biodiesel); purify; and distribute ({{XREF:10}}).

Standard Enthalpy of Formation

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp93922992}}
A __standard enthalpy of formation [[MATH:25]]__ is an enthalpy change for a reaction in which exactly 1 mole of a pure substance is formed from free elements in their most stable states under standard state conditions. These values are especially useful for computing or predicting enthalpy changes for chemical reactions that are impractical or dangerous to carry out, or for processes for which it is difficult to make measurements. If we have values for the appropriate standard enthalpies of formation, we can determine the enthalpy change for any reaction, which we will practice in the next section on Hess’s law.

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp185900096}}
The standard enthalpy of formation of CO~2~(*g*) is −393.5 kJ/mol. This is the enthalpy change for the exothermic reaction:

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp165684992}}
starting with the reactants at a pressure of 1 atm and 25 °C (with the carbon present as graphite, the most stable form of carbon under these conditions) and ending with one mole of CO~2~, also at 1 atm and 25 °C. For nitrogen dioxide, NO~2~(*g*), [[MATH:26]] is 33.2 kJ/mol. This is the enthalpy change for the reaction:

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp173428336}}
A reaction equation with [[MATH:27]] mole of N~2~ and 1 mole of O~2~ is correct in this case because the standard enthalpy of formation always refers to 1 mole of product, NO~2~(*g*).

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp173432432}}
You will find a table of standard enthalpies of formation of many common substances in Appendix G. These values indicate that formation reactions range from highly exothermic (such as −2984 kJ/mol for the formation of P~4~O~10~) to strongly endothermic (such as +226.7 kJ/mol for the formation of acetylene, C~2~H~2~). By definition, the standard enthalpy of formation of an element in its most stable form is equal to zero under standard conditions, which is 1 atm for gases and 1 M for solutions.

Hess’s Law

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp218912624}}
There are two ways to determine the amount of heat involved in a chemical change: measure it experimentally, or calculate it from other experimentally determined enthalpy changes. Some reactions are difficult, if not impossible, to investigate and make accurate measurements for experimentally. And even when a reaction is not hard to perform or measure, it is convenient to be able to determine the heat involved in a reaction without having to perform an experiment.

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp177508528}}
This type of calculation usually involves the use of __Hess’s law__, which states: *If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise processes, the enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes of the various steps*. Hess’s law is valid because enthalpy is a state function: Enthalpy changes depend only on where a chemical process starts and ends, but not on the path it takes from start to finish. For example, we can think of the reaction of carbon with oxygen to form carbon dioxide as occurring either directly or by a two-step process. The direct process is written:

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp51924752}}
In the two-step process, first carbon monoxide is formed:

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp161438416}}
Then, carbon monoxide reacts further to form carbon dioxide:

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp186572000}}
The equation describing the overall reaction is the sum of these two chemical changes:

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp40118928}}
Because the CO produced in Step 1 is consumed in Step 2, the net change is:

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp128370320}}
According to Hess’s law, the enthalpy change of the reaction will equal the sum of the enthalpy changes of the steps.

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp10365136}}
The result is shown in {{XREF:11}}. We see that Δ*H* of the overall reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or two. This finding (overall Δ*H* for the reaction = sum of Δ*H* values for reaction “steps” in the overall reaction) is true in general for chemical and physical processes.

{{SEG:m68727:caption:CNX_Chem_05_03_HessCO2-caption}}
The formation of CO~2~(*g*) from its elements can be thought of as occurring in two steps, which sum to the overall reaction, as described by Hess’s law. The horizontal blue lines represent enthalpies. For an exothermic process, the products are at lower enthalpy than are the reactants.

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp167197264}}
Before we further practice using Hess’s law, let us recall two important features of Δ*H*.

{{SEG:m68727:item:fs-idp167198464-item-1}}
Δ*H* is directly proportional to the quantities of reactants or products. For example, the enthalpy change for the reaction forming 1 mole of NO~2~(*g*) is +33.2 kJ: [[MATH:44]] When 2 moles of NO~2~ (twice as much) are formed, the Δ*H* will be twice as large: [[MATH:45]] In general, if we multiply or divide an equation by a number, then the enthalpy change should also be multiplied or divided by the same number.

{{SEG:m68727:item:fs-idp167198464-item-2}}
Δ*H* for a reaction in one direction is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to Δ*H* for the reaction in the reverse direction. For example, given that: [[MATH:46]] Then, for the “reverse” reaction, the enthalpy change is also “reversed”: [[MATH:47]]

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp167199328}}
Δ*H* is directly proportional to the quantities of reactants or products. For example, the enthalpy change for the reaction forming 1 mole of NO~2~(*g*) is +33.2 kJ:

Our goal is to manipulate and combine reactions *(ii)*, *(iii)*, and *(iv)* such that they add up to reaction *(i)*. Going from left to right in *(i)*, we first see that ClF(*g*) is needed as a reactant. This can be obtained by multiplying reaction *(iii)* by [[MATH:55]] which means that the Δ*H*° change is also multiplied by [[MATH:56]]

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp160398800}}
Next, we see that F~2~ is also needed as a reactant. To get this, reverse and halve reaction *(ii)*, which means that the Δ*H*° changes sign and is halved:

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp134606352}}

We also can use __Hess’s law__ to determine the enthalpy change of any reaction if the corresponding enthalpies of formation of the reactants and products are available. The stepwise reactions we consider are: (i) decompositions of the reactants into their component elements (for which the enthalpy changes are proportional to the negative of the enthalpies of formation of the reactants), followed by (ii) re-combinations of the elements to give the products (with the enthalpy changes proportional to the enthalpies of formation of the products). The standard enthalpy change of the overall reaction is therefore equal to: (ii) the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of all the products plus (i) the sum of the negatives of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants. This is usually rearranged slightly to be written as follows, with ∑ representing “the sum of” and *n* standing for the stoichiometric coefficients:

Writing out these reactions, and noting their relationships to the [[MATH:68]] values for these compounds (from Appendix G ), we have:

Key Concepts and Summary

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp165565984}}
If a chemical change is carried out at constant pressure and the only work done is caused by expansion or contraction, *q* for the change is called the enthalpy change with the symbol Δ*H*, or [[MATH:71]] for reactions occurring under standard state conditions at 298 K. The value of Δ*H* for a reaction in one direction is equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, to Δ*H* for the reaction in the opposite direction, and Δ*H* is directly proportional to the quantity of reactants and products. The standard enthalpy of formation, [[MATH:72]] is the enthalpy change accompanying the formation of 1 mole of a substance from the elements in their most stable states at 1 bar and 298.15 K. If the enthalpies of formation are available for the reactants and products of a reaction, the enthalpy change can be calculated using Hess’s law: If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise processes, the enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes of the various steps.
