### [[TABLE:1]]

**[[TITLE]]:** Specific Heats of Common Substances at 25 °C and 1 bar

**[[SUMMARY]]:** A table with three columns and seventeen rows is shown. The top row is the header row and contains the headers “Substance,” “State and Symbol,” and “Specific Heat (J / g ° C)”. Under the first heading are the terms “helium,” “water,” “ethanol,” “ice,” “water vapor,” “nitrogen,” “air,” “oxygen,” “aluminum,” “carbon dioxide,” “argon,” “iron,” “copper,” “lead,” “gold” and “silicon.” The second column contains the symbols and signs: “H e (g),” “H subscript 2 O (l),” “C subscript 2 H subscript 6 O (l),” “H subscript 2 O (s),” “H subscript 2 O (g),” “N subscript 2 (g),” a blank entry for air, “O subscript 2 (g),” “A l (s),” “C O subscript 2 (g),” “A r (g),” “F e (s),” “C u (s),” “P b (s),” “A u (s),” and “S I (s).” The last column contains the values “5.193,” “4.184,” “2.376,” “2.093 (at –10 °C), ” “1.864,” “1.040,” “1.007,” “0.918.” “0.897,” “0.853,” “0.522,” “0.449,” “0.385,” “0.130,” “0.129,” and “0.712.”

### [[CNX_Chem_05_01_Thermochem]]

**[[CAPTION]]:** The energy involved in chemical changes is important to our daily lives: (a) A cheeseburger for lunch provides the energy you need to get through the rest of the day; (b) the combustion of gasoline provides the energy that moves your car (and you) between home, work, and school; and (c) coke, a processed form of coal, provides the energy needed to convert iron ore into iron, which is essential for making many of the products we use daily.

**[[ALT_TEXT]]:** Three pictures are shown and labeled a, b, and c. Picture a is a cheeseburger. Picture b depicts a highway that is full of traffic. Picture c is a view into an industrial metal furnace. The view into the furnace shows a hot fire burning inside.

### [[CNX_Chem_05_01_SolTherm1]]

**[[CAPTION]]:** This solar thermal plant uses parabolic trough mirrors to concentrate sunlight. (credit a: modification of work by Bureau of Land Management)

**[[ALT_TEXT]]:** This figure has two parts labeled a and b. Part a shows rows and rows of trough mirrors. Part b shows how a solar thermal plant works. Heat transfer fluid enters a tank via pipes. The tank contains water which is heated. As the heat is exchanged from the pipes to the water, the water becomes steam. The steam travels to a steam turbine. The steam turbine begins to turn which powers a generator. Exhaust steam exits the steam turbine and enters a cooling tower.

### [[CNX_Chem_05_01_SolTherm2]]

**[[CAPTION]]:** (a) The Ivanpah solar thermal plant uses 170,000 mirrors to concentrate sunlight on water-filled towers. (b) It covers 4000 acres of public land near the Mojave Desert and the California-Nevada border. (credit a: modification of work by Craig Dietrich; credit b: modification of work by “USFWS Pacific Southwest Region”/Flickr)

**[[ALT_TEXT]]:** Two pictures are shown and labeled a and b. Picture a shows a thermal plant with three tall metal towers. Picture b is an arial picture of the mirrors used at the plant. They are arranged in rows.
