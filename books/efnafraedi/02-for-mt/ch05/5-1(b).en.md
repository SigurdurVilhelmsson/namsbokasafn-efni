For example, consider the heat capacities of two cast iron frying pans. The heat capacity of the large pan is five times greater than that of the small pan because, although both are made of the same material, the mass of the large pan is five times greater than the mass of the small pan. More mass means more atoms are present in the larger pan, so it takes more energy to make all of those atoms vibrate faster. The heat capacity of the small cast iron frying pan is found by observing that it takes 18,140 J of energy to raise the temperature of the pan by 50.0 °C:

[[EQ:2]]{id="fs-idm70951696"}

The larger cast iron frying pan, while made of the same substance, requires 90,700 J of energy to raise its temperature by 50.0 °C. The larger pan has a (proportionally) larger heat capacity because the larger amount of material requires a (proportionally) larger amount of energy to yield the same temperature change:

[[EQ:3]]{id="fs-idp13532880"}

The **specific heat capacity (*c*)**{id="term-00014"} of a substance, commonly called its “specific heat,” is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of a substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin):

[[EQ:4]]{id="fs-idm28369232"}

Specific heat capacity depends only on the kind of substance absorbing or releasing heat. It is an intensive property—the type, but not the amount, of the substance is all that matters. For example, the small cast iron frying pan has a mass of 808 g. The specific heat of iron (the material used to make the pan) is therefore:

[[EQ:5]]{id="fs-idm67226544"}

The large frying pan has a mass of 4040 g. Using the data for this pan, we can also calculate the specific heat of iron:

[[EQ:6]]{id="fs-idm54139424"}

Although the large pan is more massive than the small pan, since both are made of the same material, they both yield the same value for specific heat (for the material of construction, iron). Note that specific heat is measured in units of energy per temperature per mass and is an intensive property, being derived from a ratio of two extensive properties (heat and mass). The molar heat capacity, also an intensive property, is the heat capacity per mole of a particular substance and has units of J/mol °C ([↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_05_01_HeatCapacity"}).

*Figure 5.8: Because of its larger mass, a large frying pan has a larger heat capacity than a small frying pan. Because they are made of the same material, both frying pans have the same specific heat. (credit: Mark Blaser)*{id="CNX_Chem_05_01_HeatCapacity"}

Water has a relatively high specific heat (about 4.2 J/g °C for the liquid and 2.09 J/g °C for the solid); most metals have much lower specific heats (usually less than 1 J/g °C). The specific heat of a substance varies somewhat with temperature. However, this variation is usually small enough that we will treat specific heat as constant over the range of temperatures that will be considered in this chapter. Specific heats of some common substances are listed in [↗]{ref="fs-idm68801008"}.

**Specific Heats of Common Substances at 25 °C and 1 bar**

[[TABLE:1]]{id="fs-idm68801008"}

If we know the mass of a substance and its specific heat, we can determine the amount of heat, *q*, entering or leaving the substance by measuring the temperature change before and after the heat is gained or lost:

[[EQ:7]]{id="fs-idp8176432"}

In this equation, *c* is the specific heat of the substance, *m* is its mass, and Δ*T* (which is read “delta T”) is the temperature change, *T*~final~ − *T*~initial~. If a substance gains thermal energy, its temperature increases, its final temperature is higher than its initial temperature, *T*~final~ − *T*~initial~ has a positive value, and the value of *q* is positive. If a substance loses thermal energy, its temperature decreases, the final temperature is lower than the initial temperature, *T*~final~ − *T*~initial~ has a negative value, and the value of *q* is negative.

### Solar Thermal Energy Power Plants

The sunlight that reaches the earth contains thousands of times more energy than we presently capture. Solar thermal systems provide one possible solution to the problem of converting energy from the sun into energy we can use. Large-scale solar thermal plants have different design specifics, but all concentrate sunlight to heat some substance; the heat “stored” in that substance is then converted into electricity.

The Solana Generating Station in Arizona’s Sonora Desert produces 280 megawatts of electrical power. It uses parabolic mirrors that focus sunlight on pipes filled with a heat transfer fluid (HTF) ([↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_05_01_SolTherm1"}). The HTF then does two things: It turns water into steam, which spins turbines, which in turn produces electricity, and it melts and heats a mixture of salts, which functions as a thermal energy storage system. After the sun goes down, the molten salt mixture can then release enough of its stored heat to produce steam to run the turbines for 6 hours. Molten salts are used because they possess a number of beneficial properties, including high heat capacities and thermal conductivities.

The 377-megawatt Ivanpah Solar Generating System, located in the Mojave Desert in California, is the largest solar thermal power plant in the world ([↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_05_01_SolTherm2"}). Its 170,000 mirrors focus huge amounts of sunlight on three water-filled towers, producing steam at over 538 °C that drives electricity-producing turbines. It produces enough energy to power 140,000 homes. Water is used as the working fluid because of its large heat capacity and heat of vaporization.

Part b shows how a solar thermal plant works. Heat transfer fluid enters a tank via pipes. The tank contains water which is heated. As the heat is exchanged from the pipes to the water, the water becomes steam. The steam travels to a steam turbine. The steam turbine begins to turn which powers a generator. Exhaust steam exits the steam turbine and enters a cooling tower."}

### Example 5.1: Measuring Heat

A flask containing 8.0 [[EQ:13]] 10^2^ g of water is heated, and the temperature of the water increases from 21 °C to 85 °C. How much heat did the water absorb?

**Solution**

To answer this question, consider these factors:

The specific heat of water is 4.184 J/g °C, so to heat 1 g of water by 1 °C requires 4.184 J. We note that since 4.184 J is required to heat 1 g of water by 1 °C, we will need *800 times as much* to heat 8.0 × 10^2^ g of water by 1 °C. Finally, we observe that since 4.184 J are required to heat 1 g of water by 1 °C, we will need *64 times as much* to heat it by 64 °C (that is, from 21 °C to 85 °C).

This can be summarized using the equation:

[[EQ:8]]{id="fs-idp82666784"}

[[EQ:9]]{id="fs-idp59324528"}

Because the temperature increased, the water absorbed heat and *q* is positive.

### Example 5.2: Determining Other Quantities

A piece of unknown metal weighs 348 g. When the metal piece absorbs 6.64 kJ of heat, its temperature increases from 22.4 °C to 43.6 °C. Determine the specific heat of this metal (which might provide a clue to its identity).

**Solution**

Since mass, heat, and temperature change are known for this metal, we can determine its specific heat using the relationship:

[[EQ:10]]{id="fs-idp21155408"}

Substituting the known values:

[[EQ:11]]{id="fs-idp25098320"}

Solving:

[[EQ:12]]{id="fs-idm38894688"}

Comparing this value with the values in [↗]{ref="fs-idm68801008"}, this value matches the specific heat of aluminum, which suggests that the unknown metal may be aluminum.

**Check Your Learning**

A piece of unknown metal weighs 217 g. When the metal piece absorbs 1.43 kJ of heat, its temperature increases from 24.5 °C to 39.1 °C. Determine the specific heat of this metal, and predict its identity.

*c* = 0.451 J/g °C; the metal is likely to be iron

## Key Concepts and Summary

Energy is the capacity to supply heat or do work (applying a force to move matter). Kinetic energy (KE) is the energy of motion; potential energy is energy due to relative position, composition, or condition. When energy is converted from one form into another, energy is neither created nor destroyed (law of conservation of energy or first law of thermodynamics).

The thermal energy of matter is due to the kinetic energies of its constituent atoms or molecules. Temperature is an intensive property of matter reflecting hotness or coldness that increases as the average kinetic energy increases. Heat is the transfer of thermal energy between objects at different temperatures. Chemical and physical processes can absorb heat (endothermic) or release heat (exothermic). The SI unit of energy, heat, and work is the joule (J).

Specific heat and heat capacity are measures of the energy needed to change the temperature of a substance or object. The amount of heat absorbed or released by a substance depends directly on the type of substance, its mass, and the temperature change it undergoes.

A burning match and a bonfire may have the same temperature, yet you would not sit around a burning match on a fall evening to stay warm. Why not?

:::answer
The temperature of 1 gram of burning wood is approximately the same for both a match and a bonfire. This is an intensive property and depends on the material (wood). However, the overall amount of produced heat depends on the amount of material; this is an extensive property. The amount of wood in a bonfire is much greater than that in a match; the total amount of produced heat is also much greater, which is why we can sit around a bonfire to stay warm, but a match would not provide enough heat to keep us from getting cold.
