If a chemical change is carried out at constant pressure and the only work done is caused by expansion or contraction, *q* for the change is called the enthalpy change with the symbol Δ*H*, or [[EQ:116]] for reactions occurring under standard state conditions at 298 K. The value of Δ*H* for a reaction in one direction is equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, to Δ*H* for the reaction in the opposite direction, and Δ*H* is directly proportional to the quantity of reactants and products. The standard enthalpy of formation, [[EQ:117]] is the enthalpy change accompanying the formation of 1 mole of a substance from the elements in their most stable states at 1 bar and 298.15 K. If the enthalpies of formation are available for the reactants and products of a reaction, the enthalpy change can be calculated using Hess’s law: If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise processes, the enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes of the various steps.
