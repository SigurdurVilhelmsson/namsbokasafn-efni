So, you can use food labels to count your Calories. But where do the values come from? And how accurate are they? The caloric content of foods can be determined by using bomb calorimetry; that is, by burning the food and measuring the energy it contains. A sample of food is weighed, mixed in a blender, freeze-dried, ground into powder, and formed into a pellet. The pellet is burned inside a bomb calorimeter, and the measured temperature change is converted into energy per gram of food.

Today, the caloric content on food labels is derived using a method called the **Atwater system** that uses the average caloric content of the different chemical constituents of food, protein, carbohydrate, and fats. The average amounts are those given in the equation and are derived from the various results given by bomb calorimetry of whole foods. The carbohydrate amount is discounted a certain amount for the fiber content, which is indigestible carbohydrate. To determine the energy content of a food, the quantities of carbohydrate, protein, and fat are each multiplied by the average Calories per gram for each and the products summed to obtain the total energy.

### Example 5.3: Heat Transfer between Substances at Different Temperatures

A 360.0-g piece of rebar (a steel rod used for reinforcing concrete) is dropped into 425 mL of water at 24.0 °C. The final temperature of the water was measured as 42.7 °C. Calculate the initial temperature of the piece of rebar. Assume the specific heat of steel is approximately the same as that for iron ([↗]{ref="fs-idm68801008"}), and that all heat transfer occurs between the rebar and the water (there is no heat exchange with the surroundings).

**Solution**

The temperature of the water increases from 24.0 °C to 42.7 °C, so the water absorbs heat. That heat came from the piece of rebar, which initially was at a higher temperature. Assuming that all heat transfer was between the rebar and the water, with no heat “lost” to the outside environment, then *heat given off by rebar = −heat taken in by water*, or:

[[EQ:3]]{id="fs-idm107179568"}

Since we know how heat is related to other measurable quantities, we have:

[[EQ:4]]{id="fs-idm52673840"}

Letting f = final and i = initial, in expanded form, this becomes:

[[EQ:5]]{id="fs-idp7508656"}

The density of water is 1.0 g/mL, so 425 mL of water = 425 g. Noting that the final temperature of both the rebar and water is 42.7 °C, substituting known values yields:

[[EQ:6]]{id="fs-idm160292560"}

[[EQ:7]]{id="fs-idp7310352"}

Solving this gives *T*~i,rebar~= 248 °C, so the initial temperature of the rebar was 248 °C.

A 248-g piece of copper is dropped into 390 mL of water at 22.6 °C. The final temperature of the water was measured as 39.9 °C. Calculate the initial temperature of the piece of copper. Assume that all heat transfer occurs between the copper and the water.

The initial temperature of the copper was 335.6 °C.

**Check Your Learning**

A 248-g piece of copper initially at 314 °C is dropped into 390 mL of water initially at 22.6 °C. Assuming that all heat transfer occurs between the copper and the water, calculate the final temperature.

### Example 5.4: Identifying a Metal by Measuring Specific Heat

A 59.7 g piece of metal that had been submerged in boiling water was quickly transferred into 60.0 mL of water initially at 22.0 °C. The final temperature is 28.5 °C. Use these data to determine the specific heat of the metal. Use this result to identify the metal.

**Solution**

Assuming perfect heat transfer, *heat given off by metal = −heat taken in by water*, or:

[[EQ:8]]{id="fs-idm199710176"}

In expanded form, this is:

[[EQ:9]]{id="fs-idm4542240"}

Noting that since the metal was submerged in boiling water, its initial temperature was 100.0 °C; and that for water, 60.0 mL = 60.0 g; we have:

[[EQ:10]]{id="fs-idm127022128"}

Solving this:

[[EQ:11]]{id="fs-idm13040064"}

Comparing this with values in [↗]{ref="fs-idm68801008"}, our experimental specific heat is closest to the value for copper (0.39 J/g °C), so we identify the metal as copper.

**Check Your Learning**

A 92.9-g piece of a silver/gray metal is heated to 178.0 °C, and then quickly transferred into 75.0 mL of water initially at 24.0 °C. After 5 minutes, both the metal and the water have reached the same temperature: 29.7 °C. Determine the specific heat and the identity of the metal. (Note: You should find that the specific heat is close to that of two different metals. Explain how you can confidently determine the identity of the metal).

*c*~metal~= 0.13 J/g °C

This specific heat is close to that of either gold or lead. It would be difficult to determine which metal this was based solely on the numerical values. However, the observation that the metal is silver/gray in addition to the value for the specific heat indicates that the metal is lead.

### Example 5.5: Heat Produced by an Exothermic Reaction

When 50.0 mL of 1.00 M HCl(*aq*) and 50.0 mL of 1.00 M NaOH(*aq*), both at 22.0 °C, are added to a coffee cup calorimeter, the temperature of the mixture reaches a maximum of 28.9 °C. What is the approximate amount of heat produced by this reaction?

[[EQ:14]]{id="fs-idm32936848"}

**Solution**

To visualize what is going on, imagine that you could combine the two solutions so quickly that no reaction took place while they mixed; then after mixing, the reaction took place. At the instant of mixing, you have 100.0 mL of a mixture of HCl and NaOH at 22.0 °C. The HCl and NaOH then react until the solution temperature reaches 28.9 °C.

The heat given off by the reaction is equal to that taken in by the solution. Therefore:

[[EQ:15]]{id="fs-idm259063904"}

(It is important to remember that this relationship only holds if the calorimeter does not absorb any heat from the reaction, and there is no heat exchange between the calorimeter and the outside environment.)

Next, we know that the heat absorbed by the solution depends on its specific heat, mass, and temperature change:

[[EQ:16]]{id="fs-idm174034752"}

To proceed with this calculation, we need to make a few more reasonable assumptions or approximations. Since the solution is aqueous, we can proceed as if it were water in terms of its specific heat and mass values. The density of water is approximately 1.0 g/mL, so 100.0 mL has a mass of about 1.0 [[EQ:23]] 10^2^ g (two significant figures). The specific heat of water is approximately 4.184 J/g °C, so we use that for the specific heat of the solution. Substituting these values gives:

[[EQ:17]]{id="fs-idm261390032"}

Finally, since we are trying to find the heat of the reaction, we have:

[[EQ:18]]{id="fs-idm178566000"}

The negative sign indicates that the reaction is exothermic. It produces 2.9 kJ of heat.

When 100 mL of 0.200 M NaCl(*aq*) and 100 mL of 0.200 M AgNO~3~(*aq*), both at 21.9 °C, are mixed in a coffee cup calorimeter, the temperature increases to 23.5 °C as solid AgCl forms. How much heat is produced by this precipitation reaction? What assumptions did you make to determine your value?

1.34 [[EQ:24]] 10 ^3^ kJ, or 1.34 kJ; assume no heat is absorbed by the calorimeter, no heat is exchanged between the calorimeter and its surroundings, and that the specific heat and density of the solution are the same as those for water

### Example 5.6: Heat Flow in an Instant Ice Pack

When solid ammonium nitrate dissolves in water, the solution becomes cold. This is the basis for an “instant ice pack” ([↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_05_02_IcePack"}). When 3.21 g of solid NH~4~NO~3~ dissolves in 50.0 g of water at 24.9 °C in a calorimeter, the temperature decreases to 20.3 °C.

Calculate the value of *q* for this reaction and explain the meaning of its arithmetic sign. State any assumptions that you made.

**Solution**

We assume that the calorimeter prevents heat transfer between the solution and its external environment (including the calorimeter itself), in which case:

[[EQ:19]]{id="fs-idm127206368"}

with “rxn” and “soln” used as shorthand for “reaction” and “solution,” respectively.

Assuming also that the specific heat of the solution is the same as that for water, we have:

[[EQ:20]]{id="fs-idm183045408"}

The positive sign for *q* indicates that the dissolution is an endothermic process.

1.33 kJ; assume that the calorimeter prevents heat transfer between the solution and its external environment (including the calorimeter itself) and that the specific heat of the solution is the same as that for water

### Example 5.7: Bomb Calorimetry

When 3.12 g of glucose, C~6~H~12~O~6~, is burned in a bomb calorimeter, the temperature of the calorimeter increases from 23.8 °C to 35.6 °C. The calorimeter contains 775 g of water, and the bomb itself has a heat capacity of 893 J/°C. How much heat was produced by the combustion of the glucose sample?

**Solution**

The combustion produces heat that is primarily absorbed by the water and the bomb. (The amounts of heat absorbed by the reaction products and the unreacted excess oxygen are relatively small and dealing with them is beyond the scope of this text. We will neglect them in our calculations.)

The heat produced by the reaction is absorbed by the water and the bomb:

[[EQ:21]]{id="fs-idm137623248"}

This reaction released 48.7 kJ of heat when 3.12 g of glucose was burned.

**Check Your Learning**

When 0.963 g of benzene, C~6~H~6~, is burned in a bomb calorimeter, the temperature of the calorimeter increases by 8.39 °C. The bomb has a heat capacity of 784 J/°C and is submerged in 925 mL of water. How much heat was produced by the combustion of the benzene sample?

q~rx~ = –39.0 kJ (the reaction produced 39.0 kJ of heat)

## Key Concepts and Summary

Calorimetry is used to measure the amount of thermal energy transferred in a chemical or physical process. This requires careful measurement of the temperature change that occurs during the process and the masses of the system and surroundings. These measured quantities are then used to compute the amount of heat produced or consumed in the process using known mathematical relations.

Calorimeters are designed to minimize energy exchange between their contents and the external environment. They range from simple coffee cup calorimeters used by introductory chemistry students to sophisticated bomb calorimeters used to determine the energy content of food.

A 500-mL bottle of water at room temperature and a 2-L bottle of water at the same temperature were placed in a refrigerator. After 30 minutes, the 500-mL bottle of water had cooled to the temperature of the refrigerator. An hour later, the 2-L of water had cooled to the same temperature. When asked which sample of water lost the most heat, one student replied that both bottles lost the same amount of heat because they started at the same temperature and finished at the same temperature. A second student thought that the 2-L bottle of water lost more heat because there was more water. A third student believed that the 500-mL bottle of water lost more heat because it cooled more quickly. A fourth student thought that it was not possible to tell because we do not know the initial temperature and the final temperature of the water. Indicate which of these answers is correct and describe the error in each of the other answers.

greater, since taking the calorimeter’s heat capacity into account will compensate for the thermal energy transferred to the solution from the calorimeter; this approach includes the calorimeter itself, along with the solution, as “surroundings”: *q*~rxn~ = −(*q*~solution~ + *q*~calorimeter~); since both *q*~solution~ and *q*~calorimeter~ are negative, including the latter term (*q*~rxn~) will yield a greater value for the heat of the dissolution
