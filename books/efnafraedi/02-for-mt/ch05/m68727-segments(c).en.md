We also can use __Hess’s law__ to determine the enthalpy change of any reaction if the corresponding enthalpies of formation of the reactants and products are available. The stepwise reactions we consider are: (i) decompositions of the reactants into their component elements (for which the enthalpy changes are proportional to the negative of the enthalpies of formation of the reactants), followed by (ii) re-combinations of the elements to give the products (with the enthalpy changes proportional to the enthalpies of formation of the products). The standard enthalpy change of the overall reaction is therefore equal to: (ii) the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of all the products plus (i) the sum of the negatives of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants. This is usually rearranged slightly to be written as follows, with ∑ representing “the sum of” and *n* standing for the stoichiometric coefficients:

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp120729664}}
The following example shows in detail why this equation is valid, and how to use it to calculate the enthalpy change for a reaction of interest.

Alternatively, we can write this reaction as the sum of the decompositions of 3NO~2~(*g*) and 1H~2~O(*l*) into their constituent elements, and the formation of 2HNO~3~(*aq*) and 1NO(*g*) from their constituent elements. Writing out these reactions, and noting their relationships to the [[MATH:68]] values for these compounds (from Appendix G ), we have:

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp155650064}}
Summing these reaction equations gives the reaction we are interested in:

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp155662480}}
Summing their enthalpy changes gives the value we want to determine:

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp146119648}}
So the standard enthalpy change for this reaction is Δ*H*° = −138.4 kJ.

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp146120784}}
Note that this result was obtained by (1) multiplying the [[MATH:69]] of each product by its stoichiometric coefficient and summing those values, (2) multiplying the [[MATH:70]] of each reactant by its stoichiometric coefficient and summing those values, and then (3) subtracting the result found in (2) from the result found in (1). This is also the procedure in using the general equation, as shown.

Key Concepts and Summary

{{SEG:m68727:para:fs-idp165565984}}
If a chemical change is carried out at constant pressure and the only work done is caused by expansion or contraction, *q* for the change is called the enthalpy change with the symbol Δ*H*, or [[MATH:71]] for reactions occurring under standard state conditions at 298 K. The value of Δ*H* for a reaction in one direction is equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, to Δ*H* for the reaction in the opposite direction, and Δ*H* is directly proportional to the quantity of reactants and products. The standard enthalpy of formation, [[MATH:72]] is the enthalpy change accompanying the formation of 1 mole of a substance from the elements in their most stable states at 1 bar and 298.15 K. If the enthalpies of formation are available for the reactants and products of a reaction, the enthalpy change can be calculated using Hess’s law: If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise processes, the enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes of the various steps.
