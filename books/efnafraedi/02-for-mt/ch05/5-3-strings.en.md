### [[TABLE:1]]

**[[TITLE]]:** Standard Molar Enthalpies of Combustion

**[[SUMMARY]]:** A data table is shown that has three columns and eleven rows. The header row reads “Substance,” “Combustion reaction,” and “Enthalpy of Combustion, Δ H subscript C superscript degree symbol (k J/ mol at 25 ° C).” The first column contains entries reading “carbon,” “hydrogen,” “magnesium,” “sulfur,” “carbon monoxide,” “methane,” “acetylene,” “ethanol,” “methanol,” and “isooctane.” The second column contains the equations “C (s) + O (g) right-facing arrow C O subscript 2 (g),” “H subscript 2 (g) + one half O subscript 2 (g) right-facing arrow H subscript 2 O (l),” “M g (s) + one half O subscript 2 (g) right-facing arrow M g O (s),” “S (s) + O subscript 2 (g) right-facing arrow S O subscript 2 (g),” “C O (g) + one half O subscript 2 (g) right-facing arrow C O subscript 2 (g),” “C H subscript 4 (g) + 2 O subscript 2 (g) right-facing arrow C O subscript 2 (g) + 2 H subscript 2 O (g),” “C subscript 2 H subscript 2 (g) + five halves O subscript 2 (g) right-facing arrow 2 C O subscript 2 (g) + H subscript 2 O (l),” “C subscript 2 H subscript 5 O H (l) + 2 O subscript 2 (g) right-facing arrow C O subscript 2 (g) + 3 H subscript 2 O (l),” “C H subscript 3 O H (l) + three halves O subscript 2 (g) right-facing arrow C O subscript 2 (g) + 2 H subscript 2 O (l),” and “C subscript 8 H subscript 18 (l) + twenty five halves O subscript 2 (g) right-facing arrow 8 C O subscript 2 (g) + 9 H subscript 2 O (l).” The final column contains the values “–393.5,” “–285.8,” “–601.6,” “–296.8,” “–283.0,” “–890.8,” “–1301.1,” “–1366.8,” “–726.1,” and “–5460.”

### [[CNX_Chem_05_03_Systemqw]]

**[[CAPTION]]:** The internal energy, *U*, of a system can be changed by heat flow and work. If heat flows into the system, *q*~in~, or work is done on the system, *w*~on~, its internal energy increases, Δ*U* > 0. If heat flows out of the system, *q*~out~, or work is done by the system, *w*~by~, its internal energy decreases, Δ*U* &lt; 0.

### [[CNX_Chem_05_03_Summit]]

**[[CAPTION]]:** Paths X and Y represent two different routes to the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro. Both have the same change in elevation (altitude or elevation on a mountain is a state function; it does not depend on path), but they have very different distances traveled (distance walked is not a state function; it depends on the path). (credit: modification of work by Paul Shaffner)

**[[ALT_TEXT]]:** An aerial photo depicts a view of Mount Kilimanjaro. A straight, green arrow labeled X is drawn from the term “base,” written at the bottom of the mountain, to the term “Summit,” written at the top of the mountain. Another arrow labeled Y is draw from the base to the summit alongside the green arrow, but this arrow is pink and has three large S-shaped curves along its length.

### [[CNX_Chem_05_03_AlgalFuel1]]

**[[CAPTION]]:** (a) Tiny algal organisms can be (b) grown in large quantities and eventually (c) turned into a useful fuel such as biodiesel. (credit a: modification of work by Micah Sittig; credit b: modification of work by Robert Kerton; credit c: modification of work by John F. Williams)

**[[ALT_TEXT]]:** Three pictures are shown and labeled a, b, and c. Picture a shows a microscopic view of algal organisms. They are brown, multipart strands and net-like structures on a background of light violet. Picture b shows five large tubs full of a brown liquid containing these algal organisms. Picture c depicts a cylinder full of green liquid in the foreground and a poster in the background that has the title “From Field to Fleet.”

### [[CNX_Chem_05_03_AlgalFuel2]]

**[[CAPTION]]:** Algae convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into oil that is harvested, extracted, purified, and transformed into a variety of renewable fuels.

**[[ALT_TEXT]]:** A flowchart is shown that contains pictures and words. Reading from left to right, the terms “Grow,” “Harvest,” “Extract,” “Process and purify,” and “Jet fuel gasoline diesel” are shown with right-facing arrows in between each. Above each term, respectively, are diagrams of three containers, three cylinders lying side-by-side, a pyramid-like container with liquid inside, a factory, and a fuel pump. In the space above all of the diagrams and to the left of the images is a diagram of the sun.
