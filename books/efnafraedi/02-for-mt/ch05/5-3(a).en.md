Thermochemistry is a branch of **chemical thermodynamics**{id="term-00001"}, the science that deals with the relationships between heat, work, and other forms of energy in the context of chemical and physical processes. As we concentrate on thermochemistry in this chapter, we need to consider some widely used concepts of thermodynamics.

Substances act as reservoirs of energy, meaning that energy can be added to them or removed from them. Energy is stored in a substance when the kinetic energy of its atoms or molecules is raised. The greater kinetic energy may be in the form of increased translations (travel or straight-line motions), vibrations, or rotations of the atoms or molecules. When thermal energy is lost, the intensities of these motions decrease and the kinetic energy falls. The total of all possible kinds of energy present in a substance is called the **internal energy (*U*)**{id="term-00002"}, sometimes symbolized as *E*.

As a system undergoes a change, its internal energy can change, and energy can be transferred from the system to the surroundings, or from the surroundings to the system. Energy is transferred into a system when it absorbs heat (*q*) from the surroundings or when the surroundings do work (*w*) on the system. For example, energy is transferred into room-temperature metal wire if it is immersed in hot water (the wire absorbs heat from the water), or if you rapidly bend the wire back and forth (the wire becomes warmer because of the work done on it). Both processes increase the internal energy of the wire, which is reflected in an increase in the wire’s temperature. Conversely, energy is transferred out of a system when heat is lost from the system, or when the system does work on the surroundings.

The relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be represented by the equation:

[[EQ:1]]{id="fs-idm150109936"}

as shown in [Figure 5.13](#CNX_Chem_05_03_Systemqw). This is one version of the **first law of thermodynamics**{id="term-00003"}, and it shows that the internal energy of a system changes through heat flow into or out of the system (positive *q* is heat flow in; negative *q* is heat flow out) or work done on or by the system. The work, *w*, is positive if it is done on the system and negative if it is done by the system.

![](CNX_Chem_05_03_Systemqw.jpg){id="CNX_Chem_05_03_Systemqw" class="scaled-down"}

*Figure 5.13: The internal energy, *U*, of a system can be changed by heat flow and work. If heat flows into the system, *q*~in~, or work is done on the system, *w*~on~, its internal energy increases, Δ*U* > 0. If heat flows out of the system, *q*~out~, or work is done by the system, *w*~by~, its internal energy decreases, Δ*U* &lt; 0.*{id="CNX_Chem_05_03_Systemqw"}

A type of work called **expansion work**{id="term-00004"} (or pressure-volume work) occurs when a system pushes back the surroundings against a restraining pressure, or when the surroundings compress the system. An example of this occurs during the operation of an internal combustion engine. The reaction of gasoline and oxygen is exothermic. Some of this energy is given off as heat, and some does work pushing the piston in the cylinder. The substances involved in the reaction are the system, and the engine and the rest of the universe are the surroundings. The system loses energy by both heating and doing work on the surroundings, and its internal energy decreases. (The engine is able to keep the car moving because this process is repeated many times per second while the engine is running.) We will consider how to determine the amount of work involved in a chemical or physical change in the chapter on thermodynamics.

As discussed, the relationship between internal energy, heat, and work can be represented as Δ*U* = *q* + *w*. Internal energy is an example of a **state function**{id="term-00005"} (or state variable), whereas heat and work are not state functions. The value of a state function depends only on the state that a system is in, and not on how that state is reached. If a quantity is not a state function, then its value *does* depend on how the state is reached. An example of a state function is altitude or elevation. If you stand on the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro, you are at an altitude of 5895 m, and it does not matter whether you hiked there or parachuted there. The distance you traveled to the top of Kilimanjaro, however, is not a state function. You could climb to the summit by a direct route or by a more roundabout, circuitous path ([Figure 5.14](#CNX_Chem_05_03_Summit)). The distances traveled would differ (distance is not a state function) but the elevation reached would be the same (altitude is a state function).

![](CNX_Chem_05_03_Summit.jpg){id="CNX_Chem_05_03_Summit" class="scaled-down" alt="An aerial photo depicts a view of Mount Kilimanjaro. A straight, green arrow labeled X is drawn from the term “base,” written at the bottom of the mountain, to the term “Summit,” written at the top of the mountain. Another arrow labeled Y is draw from the base to the summit alongside the green arrow, but this arrow is pink and has three large S-shaped curves along its length."}

*Figure 5.14: Paths X and Y represent two different routes to the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro. Both have the same change in elevation (altitude or elevation on a mountain is a state function; it does not depend on path), but they have very different distances traveled (distance walked is not a state function; it depends on the path).

Chemists ordinarily use a property known as **enthalpy (*H*)**{id="term-00006"} to describe the thermodynamics of chemical and physical processes. Enthalpy is defined as the sum of a system’s internal energy (*U*) and the mathematical product of its pressure (*P*) and volume (*V*):

[[EQ:2]]{id="fs-idm231773856"}

Enthalpy is also a state function. Enthalpy values for specific substances cannot be measured directly; only enthalpy *changes* for chemical or physical processes can be determined. For processes that take place at constant pressure (a common condition for many chemical and physical changes), the **enthalpy change (Δ*H*)**{id="term-00007"} is:

[[EQ:3]]{id="fs-idm182172016"}

The mathematical product *P*Δ*V* represents work (*w*), namely, expansion or pressure-volume work as noted. By their definitions, the arithmetic signs of Δ*V* and *w* will always be opposite:

[[EQ:4]]{id="fs-idm223126448"}

Substituting this equation and the definition of internal energy into the enthalpy-change equation yields:

[[EQ:5]]{id="fs-idm223599728"}

where q~p~ is the heat of reaction under conditions of constant pressure.

And so, if a chemical or physical process is carried out at constant pressure with the only work done caused by expansion or contraction, then the heat flow (q~p~) and enthalpy change (Δ*H*) for the process are equal.

The heat given off when you operate a Bunsen burner is equal to the enthalpy change of the methane combustion reaction that takes place, since it occurs at the essentially constant pressure of the atmosphere. On the other hand, the heat produced by a reaction measured in a bomb calorimeter ([Section]{doc="m68726"}) is not equal to Δ*H* because the closed, constant-volume metal container prevents the pressure from remaining constant (it may increase or decrease if the reaction yields increased or decreased amounts of gaseous species). Chemists usually perform experiments under normal atmospheric conditions, at constant external pressure with *q* = Δ*H*, which makes enthalpy the most convenient choice for determining heat changes for chemical reactions.

The following conventions apply when using Δ*H*:

A negative value of an enthalpy change, Δ*H* &lt; 0, indicates an exothermic reaction; a positive value, Δ*H* > 0, indicates an endothermic reaction. If the direction of a chemical equation is reversed, the arithmetic sign of its Δ*H* is changed (a process that is endothermic in one direction is exothermic in the opposite direction).

Chemists use a thermochemical equation to represent the changes in both matter and energy. In a thermochemical equation, the enthalpy change of a reaction is shown as a Δ*H* value following the equation for the reaction. This Δ*H* value indicates the amount of heat associated with the reaction involving the number of moles of reactants and products *as shown in the chemical equation*. For example, consider this equation:

[[EQ:6]]{id="fs-idp13211824"}

This equation indicates that when 1 mole of hydrogen gas and [[EQ:59]] mole of oxygen gas at some temperature and pressure change to 1 mole of liquid water at the same temperature and pressure, 286 kJ of heat are released to the surroundings. If the coefficients of the chemical equation are multiplied by some factor, the enthalpy change must be multiplied by that same factor (Δ*H* is an extensive property):

[[EQ:7]]{id="fs-idm23265328"}

The enthalpy change of a reaction depends on the physical states of the reactants and products, so these must be shown. For example, when 1 mole of hydrogen gas and [[EQ:60]] mole of oxygen gas change to 1 mole of liquid water at the same temperature and pressure, 286 kJ of heat are released. If gaseous water forms, only 242 kJ of heat are released.

Writing Thermochemical EquationsWhen 0.0500 mol of HCl(*aq*) reacts with 0.0500 mol of NaOH(*aq*) to form 0.0500 mol of NaCl(*aq*), 2.9 kJ of heat are produced. Write a balanced thermochemical equation for the reaction of one mole of HCl.

[[EQ:9]]{id="fs-idp149553440"}

Solution For the reaction of 0.0500 mol acid (HCl), *q* = −2.9 kJ. The reactants are provided in stoichiometric amounts (same molar ratio as in the balanced equation), and so the amount of acid may be used to calculate a molar enthalpy change. Since Δ*H* is an extensive property, it is proportional to the amount of acid neutralized:

[[EQ:10]]{id="fs-idp125057232"}

The thermochemical equation is then

Writing Thermochemical Equations A gummy bear contains 2.67 g sucrose, C~12~H~22~O~11~. When it reacts with 7.19 g potassium chlorate, KClO~3~, 43.7 kJ of heat are produced. Write a thermochemical equation for the reaction of one mole of sucrose:

[[EQ:13]]{id="fs-idp12841552"}

Solution Unlike the previous example exercise, this one does not involve the reaction of stoichiometric amounts of reactants, and so the *limiting reactant* must be identified (it limits the yield of the reaction and the amount of thermal energy produced or consumed).

The provided amounts of the two reactants are

The provided molar ratio of perchlorate-to-sucrose is then

[[EQ:15]]{id="fs-idm378911456"}

The balanced equation indicates 8 mol KClO~3~ are required for reaction with 1 mol C~12~H~22~O~11~. Since the provided amount of KClO~3~ is less than the stoichiometric amount, it is the limiting reactant and may be used to compute the enthalpy change:

[[EQ:16]]{id="fs-idm352441488"}

Because the equation, as written, represents the reaction of 8 mol KClO~3~, the enthalpy change is

[[EQ:17]]{id="fs-idm389610336"}

The enthalpy change for this reaction is −5960 kJ, and the thermochemical equation is:

Enthalpy changes are typically tabulated for reactions in which both the reactants and products are at the same conditions. A **standard state**{id="term-00008"} is a commonly accepted set of conditions used as a reference point for the determination of properties under other different conditions. For chemists, the IUPAC standard state refers to materials under a pressure of 1 bar and solutions at 1 M, and does not specify a temperature. Many thermochemical tables list values with a standard state of 1 atm. Because the Δ*H* of a reaction changes very little with such small changes in pressure (1 bar = 0.987 atm), Δ*H* values (except for the most precisely measured values) are essentially the same under both sets of standard conditions. We will include a superscripted “o” in the enthalpy change symbol to designate standard state. Since the usual (but not technically standard) temperature is 298.15 K, this temperature will be assumed unless some other temperature is specified. Thus, the symbol [[EQ:61]] is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a process occurring under these conditions. (The symbol Δ*H* is used to indicate an enthalpy change for a reaction occurring under nonstandard conditions.)

The enthalpy changes for many types of chemical and physical processes are available in the reference literature, including those for combustion reactions, phase transitions, and formation reactions. As we discuss these quantities, it is important to pay attention to the *extensive* nature of enthalpy and enthalpy changes. Since the enthalpy change for a given reaction is proportional to the amounts of substances involved, it may be reported on that basis (i.e., as the Δ*H* for specific amounts of reactants). However, we often find it more useful to divide one extensive property (Δ*H*) by another (amount of substance), and report a per-amount *intensive* value of Δ*H*, often “normalized” to a per-mole basis. (Note that this is similar to determining the intensive property specific heat from the extensive property heat capacity, as seen previously.)
