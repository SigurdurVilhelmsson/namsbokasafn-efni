If we know the mass of a substance and its specific heat, we can determine the amount of heat, *q*, entering or leaving the substance by measuring the temperature change before and after the heat is gained or lost:

{{SEG:m68724:para:fs-idm37045440}}
In this equation, *c* is the specific heat of the substance, *m* is its mass, and Δ*T* (which is read “delta T”) is the temperature change, *T*~final~ − *T*~initial~. If a substance gains thermal energy, its temperature increases, its final temperature is higher than its initial temperature, *T*~final~ − *T*~initial~ has a positive value, and the value of *q* is positive. If a substance loses thermal energy, its temperature decreases, the final temperature is lower than the initial temperature, *T*~final~ − *T*~initial~ has a negative value, and the value of *q* is negative.

Measuring Heat

{{SEG:m68724:para:fs-idm38005904}}
A flask containing 8.0 [[MATH:1]] 10^2^ g of water is heated, and the temperature of the water increases from 21 °C to 85 °C. How much heat did the water absorb?

{{SEG:m68724:para-title:fs-idp12392592-title}}
Solution

{{SEG:m68724:para:fs-idp12392592}}
To answer this question, consider these factors:

{{SEG:m68724:para:fs-idm6508272}}
The specific heat of water is 4.184 J/g °C, so to heat 1 g of water by 1 °C requires 4.184 J. We note that since 4.184 J is required to heat 1 g of water by 1 °C, we will need *800 times as much* to heat 8.0 × 10^2^ g of water by 1 °C. Finally, we observe that since 4.184 J are required to heat 1 g of water by 1 °C, we will need *64 times as much* to heat it by 64 °C (that is, from 21 °C to 85 °C).

{{SEG:m68724:para:fs-idm16704560}}
This can be summarized using the equation:

{{SEG:m68724:para:fs-idp22566736}}
Because the temperature increased, the water absorbed heat and *q* is positive.
