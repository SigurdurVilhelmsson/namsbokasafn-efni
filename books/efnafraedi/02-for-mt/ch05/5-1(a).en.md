Chemical changes and their accompanying changes in energy are important parts of our everyday world ([Figure 5.2](#CNX_Chem_05_01_Thermochem)). The macronutrients in food (proteins, fats, and carbohydrates) undergo metabolic reactions that provide the energy to keep our bodies functioning. We burn a variety of fuels (gasoline, natural gas, coal) to produce energy for transportation, heating, and the generation of electricity. Industrial chemical reactions use enormous amounts of energy to produce raw materials (such as iron and aluminum). Energy is then used to manufacture those raw materials into useful products, such as cars, skyscrapers, and bridges.

Over 90% of the energy we use comes originally from the sun. Every day, the sun provides the earth with almost 10,000 times the amount of energy necessary to meet all of the world’s energy needs for that day. Our challenge is to find ways to convert and store incoming solar energy so that it can be used in reactions or chemical processes that are both convenient and nonpolluting. Plants and many bacteria capture solar energy through photosynthesis. We release the energy stored in plants when we burn wood or plant products such as ethanol. We also use this energy to fuel our bodies by eating food that comes directly from plants or from animals that got their energy by eating plants. Burning coal and petroleum also releases stored solar energy: These fuels are fossilized plant and animal matter.

This chapter will introduce the basic ideas of an important area of science concerned with the amount of heat absorbed or released during chemical and physical changes—an area called **thermochemistry**{id="term-00001"}. The concepts introduced in this chapter are widely used in almost all scientific and technical fields. Food scientists use them to determine the energy content of foods. Biologists study the energetics of living organisms, such as the metabolic combustion of sugar into carbon dioxide and water. The oil, gas, and transportation industries, renewable energy providers, and many others endeavor to find better methods to produce energy for our commercial and personal needs. Engineers strive to improve energy efficiency, find better ways to heat and cool our homes, refrigerate our food and drinks, and meet the energy and cooling needs of computers and electronics, among other applications. Understanding thermochemical principles is essential for chemists, physicists, biologists, geologists, every type of engineer, and just about anyone who studies or does any kind of science.

## Energy

**Energy**{id="term-00002"} can be defined as the capacity to supply heat or do work. One type of **work (*w*)**{id="term-00003"} is the process of causing matter to move against an opposing force. For example, we do work when we inflate a bicycle tire—we move matter (the air in the pump) against the opposing force of the air already in the tire.

Like matter, energy comes in different types. One scheme classifies energy into two types: **potential energy**{id="term-00004"}, the energy an object has because of its relative position, composition, or condition, and **kinetic energy**{id="term-00005"}, the energy that an object possesses because of its motion. Water at the top of a waterfall or dam has potential energy because of its position; when it flows downward through generators, it has kinetic energy that can be used to do work and produce electricity in a hydroelectric plant ([Figure 5.3](#CNX_Chem_05_01_Waterfall)). A battery has potential energy because the chemicals within it can produce electricity that can do work.

Energy can be converted from one form into another, but all of the energy present before a change occurs always exists in some form after the change is completed. This observation is expressed in the law of conservation of energy: during a chemical or physical change, energy can be neither created nor destroyed, although it can be changed in form. (This is also one version of the first law of thermodynamics, as you will learn later.)

When one substance is converted into another, there is always an associated conversion of one form of energy into another. Heat is usually released or absorbed, but sometimes the conversion involves light, electrical energy, or some other form of energy. For example, chemical energy (a type of potential energy) is stored in the molecules that compose gasoline. When gasoline is combusted within the cylinders of a car’s engine, the rapidly expanding gaseous products of this chemical reaction generate mechanical energy (a type of kinetic energy) when they move the cylinders’ pistons.

According to the law of conservation of matter (seen in an earlier chapter), there is no detectable change in the total amount of matter during a chemical change. When chemical reactions occur, the energy changes are relatively modest and the mass changes are too small to measure, so the laws of conservation of matter and energy hold well. However, in nuclear reactions, the energy changes are much larger (by factors of a million or so), the mass changes are measurable, and matter-energy conversions are significant. This will be examined in more detail in a later chapter on nuclear chemistry.

## Thermal Energy, Temperature, and Heat

**Thermal energy**{id="term-00006"} is kinetic energy associated with the random motion of atoms and molecules. **Temperature**{id="term-00007"} is a quantitative measure of “hot” or “cold.” When the atoms and molecules in an object are moving or vibrating quickly, they have a higher average kinetic energy (KE), and we say that the object is “hot.” When the atoms and molecules are moving slowly, they have lower average KE, and we say that the object is “cold” ([Figure 5.4](#CNX_Chem_05_01_HotCold)). Assuming that no chemical reaction or phase change (such as melting or vaporizing) occurs, increasing the amount of thermal energy in a sample of matter will cause its temperature to increase. And, assuming that no chemical reaction or phase change (such as condensation or freezing) occurs, decreasing the amount of thermal energy in a sample of matter will cause its temperature to decrease.

Most substances expand as their temperature increases and contract as their temperature decreases. This property can be used to measure temperature changes, as shown in [Figure 5.5](#CNX_Chem_05_01_Thermom). The operation of many thermometers depends on the expansion and contraction of substances in response to temperature changes.

**Heat (*q*)**{id="term-00008"} is the transfer of thermal energy between two bodies at different temperatures. Heat flow (a redundant term, but one commonly used) increases the thermal energy of one body and decreases the thermal energy of the other. Suppose we initially have a high temperature (and high thermal energy) substance (H) and a low temperature (and low thermal energy) substance (L). The atoms and molecules in H have a higher average KE than those in L. If we place substance H in contact with substance L, the thermal energy will flow spontaneously from substance H to substance L. The temperature of substance H will decrease, as will the average KE of its molecules; the temperature of substance L will increase, along with the average KE of its molecules. Heat flow will continue until the two substances are at the same temperature ([Figure 5.6](#CNX_Chem_05_01_HeatTrans1)).

Matter undergoing chemical reactions and physical changes can release or absorb heat. A change that releases heat is called an **exothermic process**{id="term-00009"}. For example, the combustion reaction that occurs when using an oxyacetylene torch is an exothermic process—this process also releases energy in the form of light as evidenced by the torch’s flame ([Figure 5.7](#CNX_Chem_05_01_OxyacTorch)). A reaction or change that absorbs heat is an **endothermic process**{id="term-00010"}. A cold pack used to treat muscle strains provides an example of an endothermic process. When the substances in the cold pack (water and a salt like ammonium nitrate) are brought together, the resulting process absorbs heat, leading to the sensation of cold.

Historically, energy was measured in units of **calories (cal)**{id="term-00011"}. A calorie is the amount of energy required to raise one gram of water by 1 degree C (1 kelvin). However, this quantity depends on the atmospheric pressure and the starting temperature of the water. The ease of measurement of energy changes in calories has meant that the calorie is still frequently used. The Calorie (with a capital C), or large calorie, commonly used in quantifying food energy content, is a kilocalorie. The SI unit of heat, work, and energy is the joule. A **joule (J)**{id="term-00012"} is defined as the amount of energy used when a force of 1 newton moves an object 1 meter. It is named in honor of the English physicist James Prescott Joule. One joule is equivalent to 1 kg m^2^/s^2^, which is also called 1 newton–meter. A kilojoule (kJ) is 1000 joules. To standardize its definition, 1 calorie has been set to equal 4.184 joules.

We now introduce two concepts useful in describing heat flow and temperature change. The **heat capacity (*C*)**{id="term-00013"} of a body of matter is the quantity of heat (*q*) it absorbs or releases when it experiences a temperature change (Δ*T*) of 1 degree Celsius (or equivalently, 1 kelvin):

[[EQ:1]]{id="fs-idp12406672"}

Heat capacity is determined by both the type and amount of substance that absorbs or releases heat. It is therefore an extensive property—its value is proportional to the amount of the substance.

For example, consider the heat capacities of two cast iron frying pans. The heat capacity of the large pan is five times greater than that of the small pan because, although both are made of the same material, the mass of the large pan is five times greater than the mass of the small pan. More mass means more atoms are present in the larger pan, so it takes more energy to make all of those atoms vibrate faster. The heat capacity of the small cast iron frying pan is found by observing that it takes 18,140 J of energy to raise the temperature of the pan by 50.0 °C:

[[EQ:2]]{id="fs-idm70951696"}

The larger cast iron frying pan, while made of the same substance, requires 90,700 J of energy to raise its temperature by 50.0 °C. The larger pan has a (proportionally) larger heat capacity because the larger amount of material requires a (proportionally) larger amount of energy to yield the same temperature change:

[[EQ:3]]{id="fs-idp13532880"}

The **specific heat capacity (*c*)**{id="term-00014"} of a substance, commonly called its “specific heat,” is the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of a substance by 1 degree Celsius (or 1 kelvin):

[[EQ:4]]{id="fs-idm28369232"}

Specific heat capacity depends only on the kind of substance absorbing or releasing heat. It is an intensive property—the type, but not the amount, of the substance is all that matters. For example, the small cast iron frying pan has a mass of 808 g. The specific heat of iron (the material used to make the pan) is therefore:

[[EQ:5]]{id="fs-idm67226544"}

The large frying pan has a mass of 4040 g. Using the data for this pan, we can also calculate the specific heat of iron:

[[EQ:6]]{id="fs-idm54139424"}

Although the large pan is more massive than the small pan, since both are made of the same material, they both yield the same value for specific heat (for the material of construction, iron). Note that specific heat is measured in units of energy per temperature per mass and is an intensive property, being derived from a ratio of two extensive properties (heat and mass). The molar heat capacity, also an intensive property, is the heat capacity per mole of a particular substance and has units of J/mol °C ([Figure 5.8](#CNX_Chem_05_01_HeatCapacity)).

Water has a relatively high specific heat (about 4.2 J/g °C for the liquid and 2.09 J/g °C for the solid); most metals have much lower specific heats (usually less than 1 J/g °C). The specific heat of a substance varies somewhat with temperature. However, this variation is usually small enough that we will treat specific heat as constant over the range of temperatures that will be considered in this chapter. Specific heats of some common substances are listed in [Table 5.1](#fs-idm68801008).

**Specific Heats of Common Substances at 25 °C and 1 bar**

[[TABLE:1]]{id="fs-idm68801008"}

If we know the mass of a substance and its specific heat, we can determine the amount of heat, *q*, entering or leaving the substance by measuring the temperature change before and after the heat is gained or lost:

[[EQ:7]]{id="fs-idp8176432"}

In this equation, *c* is the specific heat of the substance, *m* is its mass, and Δ*T* (which is read “delta T”) is the temperature change, *T*~final~ − *T*~initial~. If a substance gains thermal energy, its temperature increases, its final temperature is higher than its initial temperature, *T*~final~ − *T*~initial~ has a positive value, and the value of *q* is positive. If a substance loses thermal energy, its temperature decreases, the final temperature is lower than the initial temperature, *T*~final~ − *T*~initial~ has a negative value, and the value of *q* is negative.

### Example 5.1: Measuring Heat

A flask containing 8.0 [[EQ:13]] 10^2^ g of water is heated, and the temperature of the water increases from 21 °C to 85 °C. How much heat did the water absorb?

**Solution**

To answer this question, consider these factors:

The specific heat of water is 4.184 J/g °C, so to heat 1 g of water by 1 °C requires 4.184 J. We note that since 4.184 J is required to heat 1 g of water by 1 °C, we will need *800 times as much* to heat 8.0 × 10^2^ g of water by 1 °C. Finally, we observe that since 4.184 J are required to heat 1 g of water by 1 °C, we will need *64 times as much* to heat it by 64 °C (that is, from 21 °C to 85 °C).

This can be summarized using the equation:

[[EQ:8]]{id="fs-idp82666784"}

[[EQ:9]]{id="fs-idp59324528"}

Because the temperature increased, the water absorbed heat and *q* is positive.

How much heat, in joules, must be added to a 502 g iron skillet to increase its temperature from 25 °C to 250 °C? The specific heat of iron is 0.449 J/g °C.

### Answer:

5.07 [[EQ:14]] 10^4^ J

Note that the relationship between heat, specific heat, mass, and temperature change can be used to determine any of these quantities (not just heat) if the other three are known or can be deduced.

### Example 5.2: Determining Other Quantities

A piece of unknown metal weighs 348 g. When the metal piece absorbs 6.64 kJ of heat, its temperature increases from 22.4 °C to 43.6 °C. Determine the specific heat of this metal (which might provide a clue to its identity).

**Solution**

Since mass, heat, and temperature change are known for this metal, we can determine its specific heat using the relationship:

[[EQ:10]]{id="fs-idp21155408"}

Substituting the known values:

[[EQ:11]]{id="fs-idp25098320"}

Solving:

[[EQ:12]]{id="fs-idm38894688"}

Comparing this value with the values in [Table 5.1](#fs-idm68801008), this value matches the specific heat of aluminum, which suggests that the unknown metal may be aluminum.

**Check Your Learning**

A piece of unknown metal weighs 217 g. When the metal piece absorbs 1.43 kJ of heat, its temperature increases from 24.5 °C to 39.1 °C. Determine the specific heat of this metal, and predict its identity.

*c* = 0.451 J/g °C; the metal is likely to be iron
