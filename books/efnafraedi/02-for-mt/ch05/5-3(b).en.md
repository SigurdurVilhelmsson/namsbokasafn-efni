As reserves of fossil fuels diminish and become more costly to extract, the search is ongoing for replacement fuel sources for the future. Among the most promising biofuels are those derived from algae ([↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_05_03_AlgalFuel1"}). The species of algae used are nontoxic, biodegradable, and among the world’s fastest growing organisms. About 50% of algal weight is oil, which can be readily converted into fuel such as biodiesel. Algae can yield 26,000 gallons of **biofuel** per hectare—much more energy per acre than other crops. Some strains of algae can flourish in brackish water that is not usable for growing other crops. Algae can produce biodiesel, biogasoline, ethanol, butanol, methane, and even jet fuel.

According to the US Department of Energy, only 39,000 square kilometers (about 0.4% of the land mass of the US or less than [[EQ:76]] of the area used to grow corn) can produce enough algal fuel to replace all the petroleum-based fuel used in the US. The cost of algal fuels is becoming more competitive—for instance, the US Air Force is producing jet fuel from algae at a total cost of under $5 per gallon.For more on algal fuel, see http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/13/algae-solve-pentagon-fuel-problem. The process used to produce algal fuel is as follows: grow the algae (which use sunlight as their energy source and CO~2~ as a raw material); harvest the algae; extract the fuel compounds (or precursor compounds); process as necessary (e.g., perform a transesterification reaction to make biodiesel); purify; and distribute ([↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_05_03_AlgalFuel2"}).

## Standard Enthalpy of Formation

A **standard enthalpy of formation [[EQ:77]]**{id="term-00012"} is an enthalpy change for a reaction in which exactly 1 mole of a pure substance is formed from free elements in their most stable states under standard state conditions. These values are especially useful for computing or predicting enthalpy changes for chemical reactions that are impractical or dangerous to carry out, or for processes for which it is difficult to make measurements. If we have values for the appropriate standard enthalpies of formation, we can determine the enthalpy change for any reaction, which we will practice in the next section on Hess’s law.

The standard enthalpy of formation of CO~2~(*g*) is −393.5 kJ/mol. This is the enthalpy change for the exothermic reaction:

[[EQ:22]]{id="fs-idp185901552"}

starting with the reactants at a pressure of 1 atm and 25 °C (with the carbon present as graphite, the most stable form of carbon under these conditions) and ending with one mole of CO~2~, also at 1 atm and 25 °C. For nitrogen dioxide, NO~2~(*g*), [[EQ:78]] is 33.2 kJ/mol. This is the enthalpy change for the reaction:

[[EQ:23]]{id="fs-idp185944512"}

A reaction equation with [[EQ:79]] mole of N~2~ and 1 mole of O~2~ is correct in this case because the standard enthalpy of formation always refers to 1 mole of product, NO~2~(*g*).

You will find a table of standard enthalpies of formation of many common substances in [Appendix G]{doc="m68865"}. These values indicate that formation reactions range from highly exothermic (such as −2984 kJ/mol for the formation of P~4~O~10~) to strongly endothermic (such as +226.7 kJ/mol for the formation of acetylene, C~2~H~2~). By definition, the standard enthalpy of formation of an element in its most stable form is equal to zero under standard conditions, which is 1 atm for gases and 1 M for solutions.

::: example
### Example 5.4: Evaluating an Enthalpy of Formation

Ozone, O~3~(*g*), forms from oxygen, O~2~(*g*), by an endothermic process. Ultraviolet radiation is the source of the energy that drives this reaction in the upper atmosphere. Assuming that both the reactants and products of the reaction are in their standard states, determine the standard enthalpy of formation, [[EQ:80]] of ozone from the following information:

[[EQ:24]]{id="fs-idp167765152"}

**Solution**

[[EQ:81]] is the enthalpy change for the formation of one mole of a substance in its standard state from the elements in their standard states. Thus, [[EQ:82]] for O~3~(*g*) is the enthalpy change for the reaction:

[[EQ:25]]{id="fs-idp166474448"}

For the formation of 2 mol of O~3~(*g*), [[EQ:83]] This ratio, [[EQ:84]] can be used as a conversion factor to find the heat produced when 1 mole of O~3~(*g*) is formed, which is the enthalpy of formation for O~3~(*g*):

Therefore, [[EQ:85]]

The standard enthalpy of formation of HCl(*g*) is −92.3 kJ/mol.

## Hess’s Law

There are two ways to determine the amount of heat involved in a chemical change: measure it experimentally, or calculate it from other experimentally determined enthalpy changes. Some reactions are difficult, if not impossible, to investigate and make accurate measurements for experimentally. And even when a reaction is not hard to perform or measure, it is convenient to be able to determine the heat involved in a reaction without having to perform an experiment.

This type of calculation usually involves the use of **Hess’s law**{id="term-00013"}, which states: *If a process can be written as the sum of several stepwise processes, the enthalpy change of the total process equals the sum of the enthalpy changes of the various steps*. Hess’s law is valid because enthalpy is a state function: Enthalpy changes depend only on where a chemical process starts and ends, but not on the path it takes from start to finish. For example, we can think of the reaction of carbon with oxygen to form carbon dioxide as occurring either directly or by a two-step process. The direct process is written:

[[EQ:27]]{id="fs-idp177510624"}

In the two-step process, first carbon monoxide is formed:

[[EQ:28]]{id="fs-idp51925136"}

Then, carbon monoxide reacts further to form carbon dioxide:

[[EQ:29]]{id="fs-idp161438800"}

The equation describing the overall reaction is the sum of these two chemical changes:

[[EQ:30]]{id="fs-idp186572384"}

Because the CO produced in Step 1 is consumed in Step 2, the net change is:

[[EQ:31]]{id="fs-idp40119312"}

According to Hess’s law, the enthalpy change of the reaction will equal the sum of the enthalpy changes of the steps.

[[EQ:32]]{id="fs-idp128371600"}

The result is shown in [↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_05_03_HessCO2"}. We see that Δ*H* of the overall reaction is the same whether it occurs in one step or two. This finding (overall Δ*H* for the reaction = sum of Δ*H* values for reaction “steps” in the overall reaction) is true in general for chemical and physical processes.

A long arrow faces upward on the left with the phrase “H increasing.” A horizontal line at the bottom of the diagram is shown with the formula “C O subscript 2 (g)” below it. A horizontal line at the top of the diagram has the formulas “C (s) + O subscript 2 (g)” above it. The top and bottom lines are connected by a downward facing arrow with the value “Δ H = –394 k J” written beside it.

The horizontal blue lines represent enthalpies. For an exothermic process, the products are at lower enthalpy than are the reactants.*{id="CNX_Chem_05_03_HessCO2"}

Before we further practice using Hess’s law, let us recall two important features of Δ*H*.

::: example
### Example 5.6: Stepwise Calculation of [[EQ:93]] Using Hess’s Law

Determine the enthalpy of formation, [[EQ:94]] of FeCl~3~(*s*) from the enthalpy changes of the following two-step process that occurs under standard state conditions:

[[EQ:37]]{id="fs-idp103964560"}

[[EQ:38]]{id="fs-idp103976192"}

**Solution**

We are trying to find the standard enthalpy of formation of FeCl~3~(*s*), which is equal to Δ*H*° for the reaction:

[[EQ:39]]{id="fs-idp190751040"}

Looking at the reactions, we see that the reaction for which we want to find Δ*H*° is the sum of the two reactions with known Δ*H* values, so we must sum their Δ*H*s:

[[EQ:40]]{id="fs-idp133790064"}

The enthalpy of formation, [[EQ:95]] of FeCl~3~(*s*) is −399.5 kJ/mol.

### Answer:

66.4 kJ

Here is a less straightforward example that illustrates the thought process involved in solving many Hess’s law problems. It shows how we can find many standard enthalpies of formation (and other values of Δ*H*) if they are difficult to determine experimentally.

::: example
### Example 5.7: A More Challenging Problem Using Hess’s Law

Chlorine monofluoride can react with fluorine to form chlorine trifluoride:

*(i)* [[EQ:96]]

Use the reactions here to determine the Δ*H*° for reaction *(i)*:

*(ii)* [[EQ:97]]

*(iii)* [[EQ:98]]

*(iv)* [[EQ:99]]

**Solution**

Our goal is to manipulate and combine reactions *(ii)*, *(iii)*, and *(iv)* such that they add up to reaction *(i)*. Going from left to right in *(i)*, we first see that ClF(*g*) is needed as a reactant. This can be obtained by multiplying reaction *(iii)* by [[EQ:100]] which means that the Δ*H*° change is also multiplied by [[EQ:101]]

[[EQ:44]]{id="fs-idp167256800"}

Next, we see that F~2~ is also needed as a reactant. To get this, reverse and halve reaction *(ii)*, which means that the Δ*H*° changes sign and is halved:

[[EQ:45]]{id="fs-idp160400816"}

To get ClF~3~ as a product, reverse *(iv)*, changing the sign of Δ*H*°:

[[EQ:46]]{id="fs-idp134608368"}

Now check to make sure that these reactions add up to the reaction we want:

[[EQ:47]]{id="fs-idp134626752"}

Reactants [[EQ:102]] and [[EQ:103]] cancel out product O~2~; product [[EQ:104]] cancels reactant [[EQ:105]] and reactant [[EQ:106]] is cancelled by products [[EQ:107]] and OF~2~. This leaves only reactants ClF(*g*) and F~2~(*g*) and product ClF~3~(*g*), which are what we want. Since summing these three modified reactions yields the reaction of interest, summing the three modified Δ*H*° values will give the desired Δ*H*°:

[[EQ:48]]{id="fs-idm259960768"}

### Answer:

−1407 kJ

:::

We also can use **Hess’s law** to determine the enthalpy change of any reaction if the corresponding enthalpies of formation of the reactants and products are available. The stepwise reactions we consider are: (i) decompositions of the reactants into their component elements (for which the enthalpy changes are proportional to the negative of the enthalpies of formation of the reactants), followed by (ii) re-combinations of the elements to give the products (with the enthalpy changes proportional to the enthalpies of formation of the products). The standard enthalpy change of the overall reaction is therefore equal to: (ii) the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of all the products plus (i) the sum of the negatives of the standard enthalpies of formation of the reactants. This is usually rearranged slightly to be written as follows, with ∑ representing “the sum of” and *n* standing for the stoichiometric coefficients:

[[EQ:49]]{id="fs-idp120716832"}

The following example shows in detail why this equation is valid, and how to use it to calculate the enthalpy change for a reaction of interest.

::: example
### Example 5.8: Using Hess’s Law

What is the standard enthalpy change for the reaction:

[[EQ:50]]{id="fs-idp134549904"}

**Solution: Using the Equation**

Use the special form of Hess’s law given previously, and values from [Appendix G]{doc="m68865"}:

[[EQ:51]]{id="fs-idp146127936"}

[[EQ:52]]{id="fs-idp146140160"}

**Solution: Supporting Why the General Equation Is Valid**

Alternatively, we can write this reaction as the sum of the decompositions of 3NO~2~(*g*) and 1H~2~O(*l*) into their constituent elements, and the formation of 2HNO~3~(*aq*) and 1NO(*g*) from their constituent elements. Writing out these reactions, and noting their relationships to the [[EQ:113]] values for these compounds (from [Appendix G]{doc="m68865"} ), we have:

[[EQ:53]]{id="fs-idp134571776"}

[[EQ:54]]{id="fs-idp168099120"}

[[EQ:55]]{id="fs-idp168119776"}

[[EQ:56]]{id="fs-idp194526576"}

Summing these reaction equations gives the reaction we are interested in:

[[EQ:57]]{id="fs-idp155650448"}

Summing their enthalpy changes gives the value we want to determine:

[[EQ:58]]{id="fs-idp155662864"}

So the standard enthalpy change for this reaction is Δ*H*° = −138.4 kJ.

Note that this result was obtained by (1) multiplying the [[EQ:114]] of each product by its stoichiometric coefficient and summing those values, (2) multiplying the [[EQ:115]] of each reactant by its stoichiometric coefficient and summing those values, and then (3) subtracting the result found in (2) from the result found in (1). This is also the procedure in using the general equation, as shown.
