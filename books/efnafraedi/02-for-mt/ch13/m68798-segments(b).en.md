Key Concepts and Summary

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idp165520928}}
The composition of a reaction mixture may be represented by a mathematical function known as the reaction quotient, *Q*. For a reaction at equilibrium, the composition is constant, and *Q* is called the equilibrium constant, *K*.

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idp116522496}}
A homogeneous equilibrium is an equilibrium in which all components are in the same phase. A heterogeneous equilibrium is an equilibrium in which components are in two or more phases.

Equilibrium cannot be established between the liquid and the gas phase if the top is removed from the bottle because the system is not closed; one of the components of the equilibrium, the Br~2~ vapor, would escape from the bottle until all liquid disappeared. Thus, more liquid would evaporate than can condense back from the gas phase to the liquid phase.
