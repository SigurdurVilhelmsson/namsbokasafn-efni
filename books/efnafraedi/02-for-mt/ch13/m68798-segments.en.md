The status of a reversible reaction is conveniently assessed by evaluating its __reaction quotient (*Q*)__. For a reversible reaction described by

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idp11973152}}
the reaction quotient is derived directly from the stoichiometry of the balanced equation as

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idm7959200}}
where the subscript c denotes the use of molar concentrations in the expression. If the reactants and products are gaseous, a reaction quotient may be similarly derived using partial pressures:

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idm352046000}}
Note that the reaction quotient equations above are a simplification of more rigorous expressions that use *relative* values for concentrations and pressures rather than *absolute* values. These relative concentration and pressure values are dimensionless (they have no units); consequently, so are the reaction quotients. For purposes of this introductory text, it will suffice to use the simplified equations and to disregard units when computing *Q*. In most cases, this will introduce only modest errors in calculations involving reaction quotients.

Changes in concentrations and *Q~c~* for a chemical equilibrium achieved beginning with (a) a mixture of reactants only and (b) products only.

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idm122432}}
The numerical value of *Q* varies as a reaction proceeds towards equilibrium; therefore, it can serve as a useful indicator of the reaction’s status. To illustrate this point, consider the oxidation of sulfur dioxide:

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idp138846544}}
Two different experimental scenarios are depicted in {{XREF:1}}, one in which this reaction is initiated with a mixture of reactants only, SO~2~ and O~2~, and another that begins with only product, SO~3~. For the reaction that begins with a mixture of reactants only, *Q* is initially equal to zero:

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idm375739520}}
As the reaction proceeds toward equilibrium in the forward direction, reactant concentrations decrease (as does the denominator of *Q~c~*), product concentration increases (as does the numerator of *Q~c~*), and the reaction quotient consequently increases. When equilibrium is achieved, the concentrations of reactants and product remain constant, as does the value of *Q~c~*.

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idm378445456}}
If the reaction begins with only product present, the value of *Q~c~* is initially undefined (immeasurably large, or infinite):

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idm374784256}}
In this case, the reaction proceeds toward equilibrium in the reverse direction. The product concentration and the numerator of *Q~c~* decrease with time, the reactant concentrations and the denominator of *Q~c~* increase, and the reaction quotient consequently decreases until it becomes constant at equilibrium.

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idm389114784}}
The constant value of *Q* exhibited by a system at equilibrium is called the __equilibrium constant, *K*__:

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idm328721280}}
Comparison of the data plots in {{XREF:2}} shows that both experimental scenarios resulted in the same value for the equilibrium constant. This is a general observation for all equilibrium systems, known as the __law of mass action__: At a given temperature, the reaction quotient for a system at equilibrium is constant.

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idp130245328}}

Answer:

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idp130245328}}
*K~c~ =* 4.3

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idm80100288}}
By its definition, the magnitude of an equilibrium constant explicitly reflects the composition of a reaction mixture at equilibrium, and it may be interpreted with regard to the extent of the forward reaction. A reaction exhibiting a large *K* will reach equilibrium when most of the reactant has been converted to product, whereas a small *K* indicates the reaction achieves equilibrium after very little reactant has been converted. It’s important to keep in mind that the magnitude of *K* does *not* indicate how rapidly or slowly equilibrium will be reached. Some equilibria are established so quickly as to be nearly instantaneous, and others so slowly that no perceptible change is observed over the course of days, years, or longer.

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idm377606544}}
The equilibrium constant for a reaction can be used to predict the behavior of mixtures containing its reactants and/or products. As demonstrated by the sulfur dioxide oxidation process described above, a chemical reaction will proceed in whatever direction is necessary to achieve equilibrium. Comparing *Q* to *K* for an equilibrium system of interest allows prediction of what reaction (forward or reverse), if any, will occur.

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idm323833328}}
To further illustrate this important point, consider the reversible reaction shown below:

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idm373405968}}
The bar charts in {{XREF:3}} represent changes in reactant and product concentrations for three different reaction mixtures. The reaction quotients for mixtures 1 and 3 are initially lesser than the reaction’s equilibrium constant, so each of these mixtures will experience a net forward reaction to achieve equilibrium. The reaction quotient for mixture 2 is initially greater than the equilibrium constant, so this mixture will proceed in the reverse direction until equilibrium is established.

Homogeneous Equilibria

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idm54871216}}
A __homogeneous equilibrium__ is one in which all reactants and products (and any catalysts, if applicable) are present in the same phase. By this definition, homogeneous equilibria take place in *solutions*. These solutions are most commonly either liquid or gaseous phases, as shown by the examples below:

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idp11719264}}
These examples all involve aqueous solutions, those in which water functions as the solvent. In the last two examples, water also functions as a reactant, but its concentration is *not* included in the reaction quotient. The reason for this omission is related to the more rigorous form of the *Q* (or *K*) expression mentioned previously in this chapter, in which *relative concentrations for liquids and solids are equal to 1 and needn’t be included*. Consequently, reaction quotients include concentration or pressure terms only for gaseous and solute species.

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idp11805840}}
The equilibria below all involve gas-phase solutions:

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idp58545648}}
For gas-phase solutions, the equilibrium constant may be expressed in terms of either the molar concentrations (*K~c~*) or partial pressures (*K~p~*) of the reactants and products. A relation between these two *K* values may be simply derived from the ideal gas equation and the definition of molarity:

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idp123497808}}
where *P* is partial pressure, *V* is volume, *n* is molar amount, *R* is the gas constant, *T* is temperature, and *M* is molar concentration.

{{SEG:m68798:title:fs-idm377214672-title}}
Coupled Equilibria

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idm374944688}}
The equilibrium systems discussed so far have all been relatively simple, involving just single reversible reactions. Many systems, however, involve two or more *coupled* equilibrium reactions, those which have in common one or more reactant or product species. Since the law of mass action allows for a straightforward derivation of equilibrium constant expressions from balanced chemical equations, the K value for a system involving coupled equilibria can be related to the K values of the individual reactions. Three basic manipulations are involved in this approach, as described below.

{{SEG:m68798:para:fs-idm328298096}}
1. Changing the direction of a chemical equation essentially swaps the identities of “reactants” and “products,” and so the equilibrium constant for the reversed equation is simply the reciprocal of that for the forward equation.
