Liquid N~2~O~3~ is dark blue at low temperatures, but the color fades and becomes greenish at higher temperatures as the compound decomposes to NO and NO~2~. At 25 °C, a value of *K~P~* = 1.91 has been established for this decomposition. If 0.236 moles of N~2~O~3~ are placed in a 1.52-L vessel at 25 °C, calculate the equilibrium partial pressures of N~2~O~3~(*g*), NO~2~(*g*), and NO(*g*).
