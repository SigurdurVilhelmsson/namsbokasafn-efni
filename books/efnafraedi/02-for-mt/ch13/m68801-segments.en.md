Having covered the essential concepts of chemical equilibria in the preceding sections of this chapter, this final section will demonstrate the more practical aspect of using these concepts and appropriate mathematical strategies to perform various equilibrium calculations. These types of computations are essential to many areas of science and technology—for example, in the formulation and dosing of pharmaceutical products. After a drug is ingested or injected, it is typically involved in several chemical equilibria that affect its ultimate concentration in the body system of interest. Knowledge of the quantitative aspects of these equilibria is required to compute a dosage amount that will solicit the desired therapeutic effect.

<!-- SEG:m68801:para:fs-idp292035664 -->
Many of the useful equilibrium calculations that will be demonstrated here require terms representing changes in reactant and product concentrations. These terms are derived from the stoichiometry of the reaction, as illustrated by decomposition of ammonia:

<!-- SEG:m68801:para:fs-idp42253680 -->
As shown earlier in this chapter, this equilibrium may be established within a sealed container that initially contains either NH~3~ only, or a mixture of any two of the three chemical species involved in the equilibrium. Regardless of its initial composition, a reaction mixture will show the same relationships between changes in the concentrations of the three species involved, as dictated by the reaction stoichiometry (see also the related content on expressing reaction rates in the chapter on kinetics). For example, if the nitrogen concentration increases by an amount *x*:

<!-- SEG:m68801:para:fs-idp249176544 -->
the corresponding changes in the other species concentrations are

<!-- SEG:m68801:para:fs-idp146645120 -->

Calculation of an Equilibrium Constant

<!-- SEG:m68801:para:fs-idp218682752 -->
The equilibrium constant for a reaction is calculated from the equilibrium concentrations (or pressures) of its reactants and products. If these concentrations are known, the calculation simply involves their substitution into the K expression, as was illustrated by [#fs-idp54423808]. A slightly more challenging example is provided next, in which the reaction stoichiometry is used to derive equilibrium concentrations from the information provided. The basic strategy of this computation is helpful for many types of equilibrium computations and relies on the use of terms for the reactant and product concentrations *initially* present, for how they *change* as the reaction proceeds, and for what they are when the system reaches *equilibrium*. The acronym ICE is commonly used to refer to this mathematical approach, and the concentrations terms are usually gathered in a tabular format called an ICE table.

<!-- SEG:m68801:para:fs-idp127545184 -->

Calculate the equilibrium concentration of NO(*g*) in air at 1 atm pressure and 2000 °C.

rearrange to the quadratic form and solve for *x*

<!-- SEG:m68801:para:fs-idm36129424 -->
Thus [H^+^] = [CN^–^] = *x* = 8.6 [[MATH:34]] 10^–6^ *M* and [HCN] = 0.15 – *x* = 0.15 *M*.

<!-- SEG:m68801:para:fs-idm8990656 -->
Note in this case that the change in concentration is significantly less than the initial concentration (a consequence of the small *K*), and so the initial concentration experiences a negligible change:

<!-- SEG:m68801:para:fs-idm167049456 -->
This approximation allows for a more expedient mathematical approach to the calculation that avoids the need to solve for the roots of a quadratic equation:
