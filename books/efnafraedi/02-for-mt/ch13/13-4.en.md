## Calculation of an Equilibrium Constant

The equilibrium constant for a reaction is calculated from the equilibrium concentrations (or pressures) of its reactants and products. If these concentrations are known, the calculation simply involves their substitution into the K expression, as was illustrated by . A slightly more challenging example is provided next, in which the reaction stoichiometry is used to derive equilibrium concentrations from the information provided. The basic strategy of this computation is helpful for many types of equilibrium computations and relies on the use of terms for the reactant and product concentrations **initially** present, for how they **change** as the reaction proceeds, and for what they are when the system reaches **equilibrium**. The acronym ICE is commonly used to refer to this mathematical approach, and the concentrations terms are usually gathered in a tabular format called an ICE table.

If a solution with the concentrations of I~2~ and I^−^ both equal to 1.000 [[EQ:15]] 10^−3^ **M** before reaction gives an equilibrium concentration of I~2~ of 6.61 [[EQ:16]] 10^−4^ **M**, what is the equilibrium constant for the reaction?

Solution To calculate the equilibrium constants, equilibrium concentrations are needed for all the reactants and products:

Provided are the initial concentrations of the reactants and the equilibrium concentration of the product. Use this information to derive terms for the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants, presenting all the information in an ICE table.

At equilibrium the concentration of I~2~ is 6.61 [[EQ:18]] 10^−4^ **M** so that

The ICE table may now be updated with numerical values for all its concentrations:

Finally, substitute the equilibrium concentrations into the **K** expression and solve:

## Calculation of a Missing Equilibrium Concentration

When the equilibrium constant and all but one equilibrium concentration are provided, the other equilibrium concentration(s) may be calculated. A computation of this sort is illustrated in the next example exercise.

Calculation of a Missing Equilibrium ConcentrationNitrogen oxides are air pollutants produced by the reaction of nitrogen and oxygen at high temperatures. At 2000 °C, the value of the K~c~ for the reaction, [[EQ:26]] is 4.1 [[EQ:27]] 10^−4^. Calculate the equilibrium concentration of NO(**g**) in air at 1 atm pressure and 2000 °C.

## Calculation of Equilibrium Concentrations from Initial Concentrations

Perhaps the most challenging type of equilibrium calculation can be one in which equilibrium concentrations are derived from initial concentrations and an equilibrium constant. For these calculations, a four-step approach is typically useful:

The last two example exercises of this chapter demonstrate the application of this strategy.

Calculation of Equilibrium Concentrations Under certain conditions, the equilibrium constant K~c~ for the decomposition of PCl~5~(**g**) into PCl~3~(**g**) and Cl~2~(**g**) is 0.0211. What are the equilibrium concentrations of PCl~5~, PCl~3~, and Cl~2~ in a mixture that initially contained only PCl~5~ at a concentration of 1.00 **M**?

Solution Use the stepwise process described earlier.

**Determine the direction the reaction proceeds.**

The balanced equation for the decomposition of PCl~5~ is

Because only the reactant is present initially Q~c~ = 0 and the reaction will proceed to the right.

**Develop an ICE table.**

**Solve for the change and the equilibrium concentrations.**

Substituting the equilibrium concentrations into the equilibrium constant equation gives

Appendix B shows an equation of the form **ax**^2^ + **bx** + **c** = 0 can be rearranged to solve for **x**:

In this case, **a** = 1, **b** = 0.0211, and **c** = −0.0211. Substituting the appropriate values for **a**, **b**, and **c** yields:

The two roots of the quadratic are, therefore,

and

For this scenario, only the positive root is physically meaningful (concentrations are either zero or positive), and so **x** = 0.135 **M**.

The equilibrium concentrations are

**Confirm the calculated equilibrium concentrations.**

Substitution into the expression for K~c~ (to check the calculation) gives

The equilibrium constant calculated from the equilibrium concentrations is equal to the value of K~c~ given in the problem (when rounded to the proper number of significant figures).

Check Your Learning Acetic acid, CH~3~CO~2~H, reacts with ethanol, C~2~H~5~OH, to form water and ethyl acetate, CH~3~CO~2~C~2~H~5~.

The equilibrium constant for this reaction with dioxane as a solvent is 4.0. What are the equilibrium concentrations for a mixture that is initially 0.15 **M** in CH~3~CO~2~H, 0.15 **M** in C~2~H~5~OH, 0.40 **M** in CH~3~CO~2~C~2~H~5~, and 0.40 **M** in H~2~O?

[CH~3~CO~2~H] = 0.18 **M**, [C~2~H~5~OH] = 0.18 **M**, [CH~3~CO~2~C~2~H~5~] = 0.37 **M**, [H~2~O] = 0.37 **M**

Check Your Learning A 1.00-L flask is filled with 1.00 mole of H~2~ and 2.00 moles of I~2~. The value of the equilibrium constant for the reaction of hydrogen and iodine reacting to form hydrogen iodide is 50.5 under the given conditions. What are the equilibrium concentrations of H~2~, I~2~, and HI in moles/L?

[H~2~] = 0.06 **M**, [I~2~] = 1.06 **M**, [HI] = 1.88 **M**

Calculation of Equilibrium Concentrations Using an Algebra-Simplifying Assumption What are the concentrations at equilibrium of a 0.15 **M** solution of HCN?

Solution Using “**x**” to represent the concentration of each product at equilibrium gives this ICE table.

Substitute the equilibrium concentration terms into the K~c~ expression

rearrange to the quadratic form and solve for **x**

Thus [H^+^] = [CN^–^] = **x** = 8.6 [[EQ:61]] 10^–6^ **M** and [HCN] = 0.15 – **x** = 0.15 **M**.

Note in this case that the change in concentration is significantly less than the initial concentration (a consequence of the small **K**), and so the initial concentration experiences a negligible change:

This approximation allows for a more expedient mathematical approach to the calculation that avoids the need to solve for the roots of a quadratic equation:

The value of **x** calculated is, indeed, much less than the initial concentration

and so the approximation was justified. If this simplified approach were to yield a value for **x** that did **not** justify the approximation, the calculation would need to be repeated without making the approximation.

(a) On analysis, an equilibrium mixture of the substances present at the given temperature was found to contain 0.20 mol of CO, 0.30 mol of water vapor, and 0.90 mol of H~2~ in a liter. How many moles of CO~2~ were there in the equilibrium mixture?

(b) Maintaining the same temperature, additional H~2~ was added to the system, and some water vapor was removed by drying. A new equilibrium mixture was thereby established containing 0.40 mol of CO, 0.30 mol of water vapor, and 1.2 mol of H~2~ in a liter. How many moles of CO~2~ were in the new equilibrium mixture? Compare this with the quantity in part (a), and discuss whether the second value is reasonable. Explain how it is possible for the water vapor concentration to be the same in the two equilibrium solutions even though some vapor was removed before the second equilibrium was established.

(a) 0.33 mol. (b) [CO~2~] = 0.50 **M**. Added H~2~ forms some water as a result of a shift to the left after H~2~ is added.

The binding of oxygen by hemoglobin (Hb), giving oxyhemoglobin (HbO~2~), is partially regulated by the concentration of H~3~O^+^ and dissolved CO~2~ in the blood. Although the equilibrium is complicated, it can be summarized as

(a) Write the equilibrium constant expression for this reaction.

(b) Explain why the production of lactic acid and CO~2~ in a muscle during exertion stimulates release of O~2~ from the oxyhemoglobin in the blood passing through the muscle.

Liquid N~2~O~3~ is dark blue at low temperatures, but the color fades and becomes greenish at higher temperatures as the compound decomposes to NO and NO~2~. At 25 °C, a value of K~P~ = 1.91 has been established for this decomposition. If 0.236 moles of N~2~O~3~ are placed in a 1.52-L vessel at 25 °C, calculate the equilibrium partial pressures of N~2~O~3~(**g**), NO~2~(**g**), and NO(**g**).

Having covered the essential concepts of chemical equilibria in the preceding sections of this chapter, this final section will demonstrate the more practical aspect of using these concepts and appropriate mathematical strategies to perform various equilibrium calculations. These types of computations are essential to many areas of science and technology—for example, in the formulation and dosing of pharmaceutical products. After a drug is ingested or injected, it is typically involved in several chemical equilibria that affect its ultimate concentration in the body system of interest. Knowledge of the quantitative aspects of these equilibria is required to compute a dosage amount that will solicit the desired therapeutic effect.

Many of the useful equilibrium calculations that will be demonstrated here require terms representing changes in reactant and product concentrations. These terms are derived from the stoichiometry of the reaction, as illustrated by decomposition of ammonia:

As shown earlier in this chapter, this equilibrium may be established within a sealed container that initially contains either NH~3~ only, or a mixture of any two of the three chemical species involved in the equilibrium. Regardless of its initial composition, a reaction mixture will show the same relationships between changes in the concentrations of the three species involved, as dictated by the reaction stoichiometry (see also the related content on expressing reaction rates in the chapter on kinetics). For example, if the nitrogen concentration increases by an amount **x**:

the corresponding changes in the other species concentrations are

where the negative sign indicates a decrease in concentration.
