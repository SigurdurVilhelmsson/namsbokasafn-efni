      "altText": "Four graphs are shown and labeled, “a,” “b,” “c,” and “d.” All four graphs have a vertical dotted line running through the middle labeled, “Equilibrium is reached.” The y-axis on graph a is labeled, “Concentration,” and the x-axis is labeled, “Time.” Three curves are plotted on graph a. The first is labeled, “[ S O subscript 2 ];” this line starts high on the y-axis, ends midway down the y-axis, has a steep initial slope and a more gradual slope as it approaches the far right on the x-axis. The second curve on this graph is labeled, “[ O subscript 2 ];” this line mimics the first except that it starts and ends about fifty percent lower on the y-axis. The third curve is the inverse of the first in shape and is labeled, “[ S O subscript 3 ].” The y-axis on graph b is labeled, “Concentration,” and the x-axis is labeled, “Time.” Three curves are plotted on graph b. The first is labeled, “[ S O subscript 2 ];” this line starts low on the y-axis, ends midway up the y-axis, has a steep initial slope and a more gradual slope as it approaches the far right on the x-axis. The second curve on this graph is labeled, “[ O subscript 2 ];” this line mimics the first except that it ends about fifty percent lower on the y-axis. The third curve is the inverse of the first in shape and is labeled, “[ S O subscript 3 ].” The y-axis on graph c is labeled, “Reaction Quotient,” and the x-axis is labeled, “Time.” A single curve is plotted on graph c. This curve begins at the bottom of the y-axis and rises steeply up near the top of the y-axis, then levels off into a horizontal line. The top point of this line is labeled, “k.” The y-axis on graph d is labeled, “Reaction Quotient,” and the x-axis is labeled, “Time.” A single curve is plotted on graph d. This curve begins near the edge of the top of the y-axis and falls steeply toward the x-axis, then levels off into a horizontal line. The bottom point of this line is labeled, “k.”"

      "altText": "Two sets of bar graphs are shown. The left is labeled, “Before reaction,” and the right is labeled, “At equilibrium.” Both graphs have y-axes labeled, “Concentration ( M ),” and three bars on the x-axes labeled, “Mixture 1,” “Mixture 2,” and “Mixture 3.” The y-axis has a scale beginning at 0.00 and ending at 0.10, with measurement increments of 0.02. The bars on the graphs are color coded and a key is provided with a legend. Red is labeled, “C O;” blue is labeled, “H subscript 2 O;” green is labeled, “C O subscript 2,” and yellow is labeled, “H subscript 2.” The graph on the left shows the red bar for mixture one just above 0.02, labeled “0.0243,” and the blue bar near 0.05, labeled “0.0243.” For mixture two, the green bar is near 0.05, labeled “0.0468,” and the yellow bar is near 0.09, labeled “0.0468.” For mixture 3, the red bar is near 0.01, labeled “0.0330,” the blue bar is slightly above that, labeled “0.190,” with green and yellow topping it off at 0.02. Green is labeled “0.00175” and yellow is labeled “0.00160.” On the right graph, the bar for mixture one shows the red bar slightly above 0.01, labeled “0.0135,” the blue bar stacked on it rising slightly above 0.02, labeled “0.0135,” the green rising near 0.04, labeled “0.0108,” and the yellow bar reaching near 0.05, labeled “0.0108.” A label above this bar reads, “Q equals 0.640.” The bar for mixture two shows the red bar slightly above 0.02, labeled “0.0260,” the blue bar stacked on it rising near 0.05, labeled “0.0260,” the green rising near 0.07, labeled “0.0208,” and the yellow bar reaching near 0.10, labeled “0.0208.” A label above this bar reads “Q equals 0.640.” The bar for mixture three shows the red bar near 0.01, labeled “0.0231,” the blue bar stacked on it rising slightly above 0.01, labeled “0.00909,” the green rising near 0.02, labeled “0.0115,” and the yellow bar reaching 0.02, labeled “0.0117.” A label above this bar reads “Q equals 0.640”."
