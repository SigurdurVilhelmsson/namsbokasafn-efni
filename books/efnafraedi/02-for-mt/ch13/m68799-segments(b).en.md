An interesting case study highlighting these equilibrium concepts is the industrial production of ammonia, NH~3~. This substance is among the “top 10” industrial chemicals with regard to production, with roughly two billion pounds produced annually in the US. Ammonia is used as a chemical feedstock to synthesize a wide range of commercially useful compounds, including fertilizers, plastics, dyes, and explosives.

{{SEG:m68799:para:fs-idp140313264}}
Most industrial production of ammonia uses the *Haber-Bosch process* based on the following equilibrium reaction:

{{SEG:m68799:para:fs-idp44583392}}
The traits of this reaction present challenges to its use in an efficient industrial process. The equilibrium constant is relatively small (*K~p~* on the order of 10^−5^ at 25 °C), meaning very little ammonia is present in an equilibrium mixture. Also, the rate of this reaction is relatively slow at low temperatures. To raise the yield of ammonia, the industrial process is designed to operate under conditions favoring product formation:

{{SEG:m68799:item:fs-idm177221696-item-1}}
High pressures (concentrations) of reactants are used, ~150−250 atm, to shift the equilibrium right, favoring product formation.

{{SEG:m68799:item:fs-idm177221696-item-2}}
Ammonia is continually removed (collected) from the equilibrium mixture during the process, lowering its concentration and also shifting the equilibrium right.

{{SEG:m68799:item:fs-idm177221696-item-3}}
Although low temperatures favor product formation for this exothermic process, the reaction rate at low temperatures is inefficiently slow. A catalyst is used to accelerate the reaction to reasonable rates at relatively moderate temperatures (400−500 °C).

{{SEG:m68799:para:fs-idp56665040}}
A diagram illustrating a typical industrial setup for production of ammonia via the Haber-Bosch process is shown in {{XREF:3}}.

{{SEG:m68799:caption:CNX_Chem_13_03_factory-caption}}
The figure shows a typical industrial setup for the commercial production of ammonia by the Haber-Bosch process. The process operates under conditions that stress the chemical equilibrium to favor product formation.

Key Concepts and Summary

{{SEG:m68799:para:fs-idp7945600}}
Systems at equilibrium can be disturbed by changes to temperature, concentration, and, in some cases, volume and pressure. The system’s response to these disturbances is described by Le Châtelier’s principle: An equilibrium system subjected to a disturbance will shift in a way that counters the disturbance and re-establishes equilibrium. A catalyst will increase the rate of both the forward and reverse reactions of a reversible process, increasing the rate at which equilibrium is reached but not altering the equilibrium mixture’s composition (*K* does not change).

The following equation represents a reversible decomposition: [[MATH:1]]

{{SEG:m68799:problem:fs-idp25940960}}
Under what conditions will decomposition in a closed container proceed to completion so that no CaCO~3~ remains?

{{SEG:m68799:solution:fs-idp51761424}}
The amount of CaCO~3~ must be so small that [[MATH:2]] is less than *K~P~* when the CaCO~3~ has completely decomposed. In other words, the starting amount of CaCO~3~ cannot completely generate the full [[MATH:3]] required for equilibrium.

{{SEG:m68799:problem:fs-idm9674096}}
What property of a reaction can we use to predict the effect of a change in temperature on the value of an equilibrium constant?

{{SEG:m68799:solution:fs-idp145707600}}
The change in enthalpy may be used. If the reaction is exothermic, the heat produced can be thought of as a product. If the reaction is endothermic the heat added can be thought of as a reactant. Additional heat would shift an exothermic reaction back to the reactants but would shift an endothermic reaction to the products. Cooling an exothermic reaction causes the reaction to shift toward the product side; cooling an endothermic reaction would cause it to shift to the reactants’ side.

{{SEG:m68799:problem:fs-idp113241664}}
Is an equilibrium among CH~4~, O~2~, CO~2~, and H~2~O established under these conditions? Explain your answer.

{{SEG:m68799:solution:fs-idp107413808}}
No, it is not at equilibrium. Because the system is not confined, products continuously escape from the region of the flame; reactants are also added continuously from the burner and surrounding atmosphere.
