While there are many ways to determine the density of an object, perhaps the most straightforward method involves separately finding the mass and volume of the object, and then dividing the mass of the sample by its volume. In the following example, the object's mass is measured using a scale, but its volume is calculated geometrically from length measurements.

<!-- SEG:m68674:para:fs-idm10854912 -->
We can derive many units from the seven SI base units. For example, we can use the base unit of length to define a unit of volume, and the base units of mass and length to define a unit of density.

Calculation of Density

<!-- SEG:m68674:para:fs-idm112138272 -->
Gold—in bricks, bars, and coins—has been a form of currency for centuries. In order to swindle people into paying for a brick of gold without actually investing in a brick of gold, people have considered filling the centers of hollow gold bricks with lead to fool buyers into thinking that the entire brick is gold. It does not work: Lead is a dense substance, but its density is not as great as that of gold, 19.3 g/cm^3^. What is the density of lead if a cube of lead has an edge length of 2.00 cm and a mass of 90.7 g?

<!-- SEG:m68674:para-title:fs-idp40298832-title -->
Solution

<!-- SEG:m68674:para:fs-idp40298832 -->
The density of a substance can be calculated by dividing its mass by its volume. The volume of a cube is calculated by cubing the edge length.

To learn more about the relationship between mass, volume, and density, use this [interactive simulator](http://openstax.org/l/16phetmasvolden) to explore the density of different materials.

Using Displacement of Water to Determine Density

<!-- SEG:m68674:para:fs-idm108240880 -->
This exercise uses a [simulation](http://openstax.org/l/16phetmasvolden) to illustrate an alternative approach to the determination of density that involves measuring the object’s volume via displacement of water. Use the simulator to determine the densities iron and wood.

<!-- SEG:m68674:para-title:fs-idp206606992-title -->
Solution

<!-- SEG:m68674:para:fs-idp206606992 -->
Click the “turn fluid into water” button in the simulator to adjust the density of liquid in the beaker to 1.00 g/mL. Remove the red block from the beaker and note the volume of water is 25.5 mL. Select the iron sample by clicking “iron” in the table of materials at the bottom of the screen, place the iron block on the balance pan, and observe its mass is 31.48 g. Transfer the iron block to the beaker and notice that it sinks, displacing a volume of water equal to its own volume and causing the water level to rise to 29.5 mL. The volume of the iron block is therefore:

<!-- SEG:m68674:para:newness -->
The density of the iron is then calculated to be:

<!-- SEG:m68674:para:newness2 -->
Remove the iron block from the beaker, change the block material to wood, and then repeat the mass and volume measurements. Unlike iron, the wood block does not sink in the water but instead floats on the water’s surface. To measure its volume, drag it beneath the water’s surface so that it is fully submerged.

<!-- SEG:m68674:para:fs-idm92012848 -->
Note: The sink versus float behavior illustrated in this example demonstrates the property of “buoyancy” (see end of chapter [#fs-idm307823136] and [#fs-idm160286704]).

Volume

<!-- SEG:m68674:para:fs-idm77137776 -->
__Volume__ is the measure of the amount of space occupied by an object. The standard SI unit of volume is defined by the base unit of length ([#CNX_Chem_01_04_Volume]). The standard volume is a __cubic meter (m3)__, a cube with an edge length of exactly one meter. To dispense a cubic meter of water, we could build a cubic box with edge lengths of exactly one meter. This box would hold a cubic meter of water or any other substance.

<!-- SEG:m68674:para:fs-idm81813264 -->
A more commonly used unit of volume is derived from the decimeter (0.1 m, or 10 cm). A cube with edge lengths of exactly one decimeter contains a volume of one cubic decimeter (dm^3^). A __liter (L) __ is the more common name for the cubic decimeter. One liter is about 1.06 quarts.

<!-- SEG:m68674:para:fs-idm163691744 -->
A __cubic centimeter (cm3)__ is the volume of a cube with an edge length of exactly one centimeter. The abbreviation **cc** (for **c**ubic **c**entimeter) is often used by health professionals. A cubic centimeter is equivalent to a __milliliter (mL)__ and is 1/1000 of a liter.

<!-- SEG:m68674:caption:CNX_Chem_01_04_Volume-caption -->
(a) The relative volumes are shown for cubes of 1 m^3^, 1 dm^3^ (1 L), and 1 cm^3^ (1 mL) (not to scale). (b) The diameter of a dime is compared relative to the edge length of a 1-cm^3^ (1-mL) cube.

<!-- SEG:m68674:title:fs-idm18447104-title -->
Density

<!-- SEG:m68674:para:fs-idp205372288 -->
We use the mass and volume of a substance to determine its density. Thus, the units of density are defined by the base units of mass and length.

<!-- SEG:m68674:para:fs-idm74744496 -->
The __density__ of a substance is the ratio of the mass of a sample of the substance to its volume. The SI unit for density is the kilogram per cubic meter (kg/m^3^). For many situations, however, this is an inconvenient unit, and we often use grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm^3^) for the densities of solids and liquids, and grams per liter (g/L) for gases. Although there are exceptions, most liquids and solids have densities that range from about 0.7 g/cm^3^ (the density of gasoline) to 19 g/cm^3^ (the density of gold). The density of air is about 1.2 g/L. [#fs-idm45639696] shows the densities of some common substances.

Key Concepts and Summary

<!-- SEG:m68674:para:fs-idm330017088 -->
Measurements provide quantitative information that is critical in studying and practicing chemistry. Each measurement has an amount, a unit for comparison, and an uncertainty. Measurements can be represented in either decimal or scientific notation. Scientists primarily use SI (International System) units such as meters, seconds, and kilograms, as well as derived units, such as liters (for volume) and g/cm^3^ (for density). In many cases, it is convenient to use prefixes that yield fractional and multiple units, such as microseconds (10^−6^ seconds) and megahertz (10^6^ hertz), respectively.
