The __density__ of a substance is the ratio of the mass of a sample of the substance to its volume. The SI unit for density is the kilogram per cubic meter (kg/m^3^). For many situations, however, this is an inconvenient unit, and we often use grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm^3^) for the densities of solids and liquids, and grams per liter (g/L) for gases. Although there are exceptions, most liquids and solids have densities that range from about 0.7 g/cm^3^ (the density of gasoline) to 19 g/cm^3^ (the density of gold). The density of air is about 1.2 g/L. {{XREF:19}} shows the densities of some common substances.

While there are many ways to determine the density of an object, perhaps the most straightforward method involves separately finding the mass and volume of the object, and then dividing the mass of the sample by its volume. In the following example, the object's mass is measured using a scale, but its volume is calculated geometrically from length measurements.

Key Concepts and Summary

{{SEG:m68674:para:fs-idm330017088}}
Measurements provide quantitative information that is critical in studying and practicing chemistry. Each measurement has an amount, a unit for comparison, and an uncertainty. Measurements can be represented in either decimal or scientific notation. Scientists primarily use SI (International System) units such as meters, seconds, and kilograms, as well as derived units, such as liters (for volume) and g/cm^3^ (for density). In many cases, it is convenient to use prefixes that yield fractional and multiple units, such as microseconds (10^−6^ seconds) and megahertz (10^6^ hertz), respectively.

Visit this {{LINK:7}}density simulation{{/LINK}} and click the “turn fluid into water” button to adjust the density of liquid in the beaker to 1.00 g/mL. Change the block material to foam, and then wait patiently until the foam block stops bobbing up and down in the water.

{{SEG:m68674:problem:fs-idm153136896}}
(a) The foam block should be floating on the surface of the water (that is, only partially submerged). What is the volume of water displaced? (b) Use the water volume from part (a) and the density of water (1.00 g/mL) to calculate the mass of water displaced. (c) Remove and weigh the foam block.

(a) displaced water volume = 2.8 mL; (b) displaced water mass = 2.8 g; (c) The block mass is 2.76 g, essentially equal to the mass of displaced water (2.8 g) and consistent with Archimedes’ principle of buoyancy.
