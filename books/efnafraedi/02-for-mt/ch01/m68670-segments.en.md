The characteristics that distinguish one substance from another are called properties. A __physical property__ is a characteristic of matter that is not associated with a change in its chemical composition. Familiar examples of physical properties include density, color, hardness, melting and boiling points, and electrical conductivity. Some physical properties, such as density and color, may be observed without changing the physical state of the matter. Other physical properties, such as the melting temperature of iron or the freezing temperature of water, can only be observed as matter undergoes a physical change. A __physical change__ is a change in the state or properties of matter without any accompanying change in the chemical identities of the substances contained in the matter. Physical changes are observed when wax melts, when sugar dissolves in coffee, and when steam condenses into liquid water ([#CNX_Chem_01_03_PhysChange]). Other examples of physical changes include magnetizing and demagnetizing metals (as is done with common antitheft security tags) and grinding solids into powders (which can sometimes yield noticeable changes in color). In each of these examples, there is a change in the physical state, form, or properties of the substance, but no change in its chemical composition.

The ability to change from one type of matter into another (or the inability to change) is a __chemical property__. Examples of chemical properties include flammability, toxicity, acidity, and many other types of reactivity. Iron, for example, combines with oxygen in the presence of water to form rust; chromium does not oxidize ([#CNX_Chem_01_03_Rust]). Nitroglycerin is very dangerous because it explodes easily; neon poses almost no hazard because it is very unreactive.

<!-- SEG:m68670:para:fs-idp137402768 -->
A __chemical change__ always produces one or more types of matter that differ from the matter present before the change. The formation of rust is a chemical change because rust is a different kind of matter than the iron, oxygen, and water present before the rust formed. The explosion of nitroglycerin is a chemical change because the gases produced are very different kinds of matter from the original substance. Other examples of chemical changes include reactions that are performed in a lab (such as copper reacting with nitric acid), all forms of combustion (burning), and food being cooked, digested, or rotting ([#CNX_Chem_01_03_ChemChange]).

(b) During the combustion of a match, cellulose in the match and oxygen from the air undergo a chemical change to form carbon dioxide and water vapor. (c) Cooking red meat causes a number of chemical changes, including the oxidation of iron in myoglobin that results in the familiar red-to-brown color change.

Properties of matter fall into one of two categories. If the property depends on the amount of matter present, it is an __extensive property__. The mass and volume of a substance are examples of extensive properties; for instance, a gallon of milk has a larger mass than a cup of milk. The value of an extensive property is directly proportional to the amount of matter in question. If the property of a sample of matter does not depend on the amount of matter present, it is an __intensive property__. Temperature is an example of an intensive property. If the gallon and cup of milk are each at 20 °C (room temperature), when they are combined, the temperature remains at 20 °C. As another example, consider the distinct but related properties of heat and temperature. A drop of hot cooking oil spattered on your arm causes brief, minor discomfort, whereas a pot of hot oil yields severe burns. Both the drop and the pot of oil are at the same temperature (an intensive property), but the pot clearly contains much more heat (extensive property).

Hazard Diamond

<!-- SEG:m68670:para:fs-idp7982032 -->
You may have seen the symbol shown in [#CNX_Chem_01_03_HazDiamond] on containers of chemicals in a laboratory or workplace. Sometimes called a “fire diamond” or “hazard diamond,” this chemical hazard diamond provides valuable information that briefly summarizes the various dangers of which to be aware when working with a particular substance.

<!-- SEG:m68670:para:fs-idp114795152 -->
The National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) 704 Hazard Identification System was developed by NFPA to provide safety information about certain substances. The system details flammability, reactivity, health, and other hazards. Within the overall diamond symbol, the top (red) diamond specifies the level of fire hazard (temperature range for flash point). The blue (left) diamond indicates the level of health hazard. The yellow (right) diamond describes reactivity hazards, such as how readily the substance will undergo detonation or a violent chemical change. The white (bottom) diamond points out special hazards, such as if it is an oxidizer (which allows the substance to burn in the absence of air/oxygen), undergoes an unusual or dangerous reaction with water, is corrosive, acidic, alkaline, a biological hazard, radioactive, and so on. Each hazard is rated on a scale from 0 to 4, with 0 being no hazard and 4 being extremely hazardous.

While many elements differ dramatically in their chemical and physical properties, some elements have similar properties. For example, many elements conduct heat and electricity well, whereas others are poor conductors. These properties can be used to sort the elements into three classes: metals (elements that conduct well), nonmetals (elements that conduct poorly), and metalloids (elements that have intermediate conductivities).

<!-- SEG:m68670:para:fs-idp108454304 -->
The periodic table is a table of elements that places elements with similar properties close together ([#CNX_Chem_01_03_PeriodicPU]). You will learn more about the periodic table as you continue your study of chemistry.

<!-- SEG:m68670:caption:CNX_Chem_01_03_PeriodicPU-caption -->
The periodic table shows how elements may be grouped according to certain similar properties. Note the background color denotes whether an element is a metal, metalloid, or nonmetal, whereas the element symbol color indicates whether it is a solid, liquid, or gas.

Key Concepts and Summary

<!-- SEG:m68670:para:fs-idp236281408 -->
All substances have distinct physical and chemical properties, and may undergo physical or chemical changes. Physical properties, such as hardness and boiling point, and physical changes, such as melting or freezing, do not involve a change in the composition of matter. Chemical properties, such flammability and acidity, and chemical changes, such as rusting, involve production of matter that differs from that present beforehand.

<!-- SEG:m68670:para:fs-idp132347232 -->
Measurable properties fall into one of two categories. Extensive properties depend on the amount of matter present, for example, the mass of gold. Intensive properties do not depend on the amount of matter present, for example, the density of gold. Heat is an example of an extensive property, and temperature is an example of an intensive property.

Explain the difference between extensive properties and intensive properties.

<!-- SEG:m68670:solution:fs-idp206310368 -->
The value of an extensive property depends upon the amount of matter being considered, whereas the value of an intensive property is the same regardless of the amount of matter being considered.

<!-- SEG:m68670:problem:fs-idp308135184 -->
Identify the following properties as either extensive or intensive.

<!-- SEG:m68670:problem:fs-idp81282624 -->
(a) volume

<!-- SEG:m68670:problem:fs-idp81282625 -->
(b) temperature

<!-- SEG:m68670:problem:fs-idp81282626 -->
(c) humidity

<!-- SEG:m68670:problem:fs-idp81282627 -->
(d) heat

<!-- SEG:m68670:problem:fs-idp81282628 -->
(e) boiling point

<!-- SEG:m68670:problem:fs-idp153016768 -->
The density (d) of a substance is an intensive property that is defined as the ratio of its mass (m) to its volume (V).

<!-- SEG:m68670:problem:fs-idp178060896 -->
Considering that mass and volume are both extensive properties, explain why their ratio, density, is intensive.

<!-- SEG:m68670:solution:fs-idp166947136 -->
Being extensive properties, both mass and volume are directly proportional to the amount of substance under study. Dividing one extensive property by another will in effect “cancel” this dependence on amount, yielding a ratio that is independent of amount (an intensive property).
