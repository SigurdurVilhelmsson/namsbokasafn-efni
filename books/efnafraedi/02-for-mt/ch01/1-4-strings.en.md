### Table 1

**Title:** Base Units of the SI System

**Summary:** Length is measured with the meter, which is symbolized using a lowercase M. Mass is measured with the kilogram which is symbolized with a lowercase K G. Time is measured with the second, which is symbolized with a lowercase S. Temperature is measured with the kelvin which is symbolized with an uppercase K. Electric current is measured with the ampere which is symbolized with an uppercase A. The amount of a substance is measured with the mole, which is symbolized with the lowercase letters, M O L. Luminous intensity is measured with the candela, which is symbolized with the lowercase letters C D.

### Table 2

**Title:** Common Unit Prefixes

**Summary:** The prefix femto has the symbol lowercase f and a factor of 10 to the negative fifteenth power. Therefore, 1 femtosecond, F S, is equal to 1 times 10 to the negative 15 of a meter, or 0.000000000001 of a meter. The prefix pico has the symbol lowercase P and a factor of 10 to the negative twelfth power. Therefore, 1 picosecond, P S, is equal to 1 times 10 to the negative 12 of a meter, or 0.000000000001 of a meter. The prefix nano has the symbol lowercase N and a factor of 10 to the negative ninth power. Therefore, 4 nanograms, or NG, equals 4 times ten to the negative 9, or 0.000000004 g. The prefix micro has the greek letter mu as its symbol and a factor of 10 to the negative sixth power. Therefore, 1 microliter, or mu L, is equal to one times ten to the negative 6 or 0.000001 L. The prefix milli has a lowercase M as its symbol and a factor of 10 to the negative third power. Therefore, 2 millimoles, or M mol, are equal to two times ten to the negative 3 or 0.002 mol. The prefix centi has a lowercase C as its symbol and a factor of 10 to the negative second power. Therefore, 7 centimeters, or C M, are equal to seven times ten to the negative 2 meters or 0.07 M O L. The prefix deci has a lowercase D as its symbol and a factor of 10 to the negative first power. Therefore, 1 deciliter, or lowercase D uppercase L, are equal to one times ten to the negative 1 meters or 0.1 L. The prefix kilo has a lowercase K as its symbol and a factor of 10 to the third power. Therefore, 1 kilometer, or K M, is equal to one times ten to the third meters or 1000 M. The prefix mega has an uppercase M as its symbol and a factor of 10 to the sixth power. Therefore, 3 megahertz, or M H Z, are equal to three times 10 to the sixth hertz, or 3000000 H Z. The prefix giga has an uppercase G as its symbol and a factor of 10 to the ninth power. Therefore, 8 gigayears, or G Y R, are equal to eight times 10 to the ninth years, or 800000000 G Y R. The prefix tera has an uppercase T as its symbol and a factor of 10 to the twelfth power. Therefore, 5 terawatts, or T W, are equal to five times 10 to the twelfth watts, or 5000000000000 W.

### Table 3

**Title:** Densities of Common Substances

**Summary:** This table reports the density of solids, liquids, and gases in grams per centimeters cubed. The values for solids are ice 0.92, oak wood 0.60 to 0.90, iron 7.9, copper 9.0, lead 11.3, silver 10.5, and gold 19.3. The values for liquids are water 1.0, ethanol 0.79, acetone 0.79, glycerin 1.26, olive oil 0.92, gasoline 0.70 to 0.77, and Mercury 13.6. The values for gases, which were measured when the gas was at 25 degrees Celsius and 1 atmosphere, are dry air 1.20, oxygen 1.31, nitrogen 1.14, carbon dioxide 1.80, helium 0.16, neon 0.83, and radon 9.1.

## Figures

### CNX_Chem_01_04_MYdCmIn

**Caption:** The relative lengths of 1 m, 1 yd, 1 cm, and 1 in. are shown (not actual size), as well as comparisons of 2.54 cm and 1 in., and of 1 m and 1.094 yd.

**Alt text:** One meter is slightly larger than a yard and one centimeter is less than half the size of one inch. 1 inch is equal to 2.54 cm. 1 m is equal to 1.094 yards which is equal to 39.36 inches.

### CNX_Chem_01_04_Kilogram

**Caption:** This replica prototype kilogram as previously defined is housed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Maryland. (credit: National Institutes of Standards and Technology)

**Alt text:** The photo shows a small metal cylinder on a stand. The cylinder is covered with 2 glass lids, with the smaller glass lid encased within the larger glass lid.

### CNX_Chem_01_04_Volume

**Caption:** (a) The relative volumes are shown for cubes of 1 m^3^, 1 dm^3^ (1 L), and 1 cm^3^ (1 mL) (not to scale). (b) The diameter of a dime is compared relative to the edge length of a 1-cm^3^ (1-mL) cube.

**Alt text:** Figure A shows a large cube, which has a volume of 1 meter cubed. This larger cube is made up of many smaller cubes in a 10 by 10 pattern. Each of these smaller cubes has a volume of 1 decimeter cubed, or one liter. Each of these smaller cubes is, in turn, made up of many tiny cubes. Each of these tiny cubes has a volume of 1 centimeter cubed, or one milliliter. A one cubic centimeter cube is about the same width as a dime, which has a width of 1.8 centimeter.
