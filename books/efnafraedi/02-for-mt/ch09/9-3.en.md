The study of the chemical behavior of gases was part of the basis of perhaps the most fundamental chemical revolution in history. French nobleman Antoine **Lavoisier**, widely regarded as the “father of modern chemistry,” changed chemistry from a qualitative to a quantitative science through his work with gases. He discovered the law of conservation of matter, discovered the role of oxygen in combustion reactions, determined the composition of air, explained respiration in terms of chemical reactions, and more. He was a casualty of the French Revolution, guillotined in 1794. Of his death, mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange said, “It took the mob only a moment to remove his head; a century will not suffice to reproduce it.”“Quotations by Joseph-Louis Lagrange,” last modified February 2006, accessed February 10, 2015, http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Quotations/Lagrange.html Much of the knowledge we do have about Lavoisier's contributions is due to his wife, Marie-Anne Paulze Lavoisier, who worked with him in his lab. A trained artist fluent in several languages, she created detailed illustrations of the equipment in his lab, and translated texts from foreign scientists to complement his knowledge. After his execution, she was instrumental in publishing Lavoisier's major treatise, which unified many concepts of chemistry and laid the groundwork for significant further study.

As described in an earlier chapter of this text, we can turn to chemical stoichiometry for answers to many of the questions that ask “How much?” The essential property involved in such use of stoichiometry is the amount of substance, typically measured in moles (*n*). For gases, molar amount can be derived from convenient experimental measurements of pressure, temperature, and volume. Therefore, these measurements are useful in assessing the stoichiometry of pure gases, gas mixtures, and chemical reactions involving gases. This section will not introduce any new material or ideas, but will provide examples of applications and ways to integrate concepts already discussed.

## Gas Density and Molar Mass

The ideal gas law described previously in this chapter relates the properties of pressure *P*, volume *V*, temperature *T*, and molar amount *n*. This law is universal, relating these properties in identical fashion regardless of the chemical identity of the gas:

[[EQ:1]]{id="fs-idm185500528"}

The density *d* of a gas, on the other hand, is determined by its identity. As described in another chapter of this text, the density of a substance is a characteristic property that may be used to identify the substance.

[[EQ:2]]{id="fs-idm214345680"}

Rearranging the ideal gas equation to isolate *V* and substituting into the density equation yields

[[EQ:3]]{id="fs-idm162939760"}

The ratio *m*/*n* is the definition of molar mass, *ℳ*:

[[EQ:4]]{id="fs-idm465259200"}

The density equation can then be written

[[EQ:5]]{id="fs-idm487853552"}

This relation may be used for calculating the densities of gases of known identities at specified values of pressure and temperature as demonstrated in [↗]{ref="fs-idp128586304"}.

When the identity of a gas is unknown, measurements of the mass, pressure, volume, and temperature of a sample can be used to calculate the molar mass of the gas (a useful property for identification purposes). Combining the ideal gas equation

[[EQ:7]]{id="fs-idm200001904"}

and the definition of molar mass

[[EQ:8]]{id="fs-idm479492256"}

yields the following equation:

[[EQ:9]]{id="fs-idm441399648"}

Determining the molar mass of a gas via this approach is demonstrated in [↗]{ref="fs-idp74274064"}.

::: example
### Example 9.8: Determining the Molecular Formula of a Gas from its Molar Mass and Empirical Formula

Cyclopropane, a gas once used with oxygen as a general anesthetic, is composed of 85.7% carbon and 14.3% hydrogen by mass. Find the empirical formula. If 1.56 g of cyclopropane occupies a volume of 1.00 L at 0.984 atm and 50 °C, what is the molecular formula for cyclopropane?

**Solution**

First determine the empirical formula of the gas. Assume 100 g and convert the percentage of each element into grams. Determine the number of moles of carbon and hydrogen in the 100-g sample of cyclopropane. Divide by the smallest number of moles to relate the number of moles of carbon to the number of moles of hydrogen. In the last step, realize that the smallest whole number ratio is the empirical formula:

[[EQ:10]]{id="fs-idm18588864"}

[[EQ:11]]{id="fs-idm150258896"}

Empirical formula is CH~2~ [empirical mass (EM) of 14.03 g/empirical unit].

Next, use the provided values for mass, pressure, temperature and volume to compute the molar mass of the gas:

[[EQ:12]]{id="fs-idp110330000"}

Comparing the molar mass to the empirical formula mass shows how many empirical formula units make up a molecule:

[[EQ:13]]{id="fs-idm220246400"}

The molecular formula is thus derived from the empirical formula by multiplying each of its subscripts by three:

## The Pressure of a Mixture of Gases: Dalton’s Law

Unless they chemically react with each other, the individual gases in a mixture of gases do not affect each other’s pressure. Each individual gas in a mixture exerts the same pressure that it would exert if it were present alone in the container ([↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_09_03_DaltonLaw1"}). The pressure exerted by each individual gas in a mixture is called its **partial pressure**{id="term-00002"}. This observation is summarized by **Dalton’s law of partial pressures**{id="term-00003"}: *The total pressure of a mixture of ideal gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the component gases*:

[[EQ:16]]{id="fs-idp65742144"}

In the equation P~Total~ is the total pressure of a mixture of gases, P~A~ is the partial pressure of gas A; P~B~ is the partial pressure of gas B; P~C~ is the partial pressure of gas C; and so on.

![](CNX_Chem_09_03_DaltonLaw1-f981.jpg){id="CNX_Chem_09_03_DaltonLaw1" alt="This figure includes images of four gas-filled cylinders or tanks. Each has a valve at the top. The interior of the first cylinder is shaded blue. This region contains 5 small blue circles that are evenly distributed. The label “300 k P a” is on the cylinder. The second cylinder is shaded lavender. This region contains 8 small purple circles that are evenly distributed. The label “450 k P a” is on the cylinder. To the right of these cylinders is a third cylinder. Its interior is shaded pale yellow. This region contains 12 small yellow circles that are evenly distributed. The label “6000 k P a” is on this region of the cylinder. An arrow labeled “Total pressure combined” appears to the right of these three cylinders. This arrow points to a fourth cylinder. The interior of this cylinder is shaded a pale green. It contains evenly distributed small circles in the following quantities and colors; 5 blue, 8 purple, and 12 yellow. This cylinder is labeled “1350 k P a.”"}

*Figure 9.20: If equal-volume cylinders containing gasses at pressures of 300 kPa, 450 kPa, and 600 kPa are all combined in the same-size cylinder, the total pressure of the gas mixture is 1350 kPa.*{id="CNX_Chem_09_03_DaltonLaw1"}

The partial pressure of gas A is related to the total pressure of the gas mixture via its **mole fraction (*X*)**{id="term-00004"}, a unit of concentration defined as the number of moles of a component of a solution divided by the total number of moles of all components:

[[EQ:17]]{id="fs-idp18188304"}

where P~A~, X~A~, and n~A~ are the partial pressure, mole fraction, and number of moles of gas A, respectively, and n~Total~ is the number of moles of all components in the mixture.

## Collection of Gases over Water

A simple way to collect gases that do not react with water is to capture them in a bottle that has been filled with water and inverted into a dish filled with water. The pressure of the gas inside the bottle can be made equal to the air pressure outside by raising or lowering the bottle. When the water level is the same both inside and outside the bottle ([↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_09_03_WaterVapor"}), the pressure of the gas is equal to the atmospheric pressure, which can be measured with a barometer.

![](CNX_Chem_09_03_WaterVapor.jpg){id="CNX_Chem_09_03_WaterVapor" class="scaled-down" alt="This figure shows a diagram of equipment used for collecting a gas over water. To the left is an Erlenmeyer flask. It is approximately two thirds full of a lavender colored liquid. Bubbles are evident in the liquid. The label “Reaction Producing Gas” appears below the flask. A line segment connects this label to the liquid in the flask. The flask has a stopper in it through which a single glass tube extends from the open region above the liquid in the flask up, through the stopper, to the right, then angles down into a pan that is nearly full of light blue water. This tube again extends right once it is well beneath the water’s surface. It then bends up into an inverted flask which is labeled “Collection Flask.” This collection flask is positioned with its mouth beneath the surface of the light blue water and appears approximately half full. Bubbles are evident in the water in the inverted flask. The open space above the water in the inverted flask is labeled “collected gas.”"}

*Figure 9.21: When a reaction produces a gas that is collected above water, the trapped gas is a mixture of the gas produced by the reaction and water vapor. If the collection flask is appropriately positioned to equalize the water levels both within and outside the flask, the pressure of the trapped gas mixture will equal the atmospheric pressure outside the flask (see the earlier discussion of manometers).*{id="CNX_Chem_09_03_WaterVapor"}

However, there is another factor we must consider when we measure the pressure of the gas by this method. Water evaporates and there is always gaseous water (water vapor) above a sample of liquid water. As a gas is collected over water, it becomes saturated with water vapor and the total pressure of the mixture equals the partial pressure of the gas plus the partial pressure of the water vapor. The pressure of the pure gas is therefore equal to the total pressure minus the pressure of the water vapor—this is referred to as the “dry” gas pressure, that is, the pressure of the gas only, without water vapor. The **vapor pressure of water**{id="term-00005"}, which is the pressure exerted by water vapor in equilibrium with liquid water in a closed container, depends on the temperature ([↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_09_03_WaterVapor2"}); more detailed information on the temperature dependence of water vapor can be found in [↗]{ref="fs-idm68841392"}, and vapor pressure will be discussed in more detail in the next chapter on liquids.

## Chemical Stoichiometry and Gases

Chemical stoichiometry describes the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in chemical reactions.

We have previously measured quantities of reactants and products using masses for solids and volumes in conjunction with the molarity for solutions; now we can also use gas volumes to indicate quantities. If we know the volume, pressure, and temperature of a gas, we can use the ideal gas equation to calculate how many moles of the gas are present. If we know how many moles of a gas are involved, we can calculate the volume of a gas at any temperature and pressure.

## Avogadro’s Law Revisited

Sometimes we can take advantage of a simplifying feature of the stoichiometry of gases that solids and solutions do not exhibit: All gases that show ideal behavior contain the same number of molecules in the same volume (at the same temperature and pressure). Thus, the ratios of volumes of gases involved in a chemical reaction are given by the coefficients in the equation for the reaction, provided that the gas volumes are measured at the same temperature and pressure.

We can extend Avogadro’s law (that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of the gas) to chemical reactions with gases: Gases combine, or react, in definite and simple proportions by volume, provided that all gas volumes are measured at the same temperature and pressure. For example, since nitrogen and hydrogen gases react to produce ammonia gas according to [[EQ:48]] a given volume of nitrogen gas reacts with three times that volume of hydrogen gas to produce two times that volume of ammonia gas, if pressure and temperature remain constant.

The explanation for this is illustrated in [↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_09_03_Ammonia"}. According to Avogadro’s law, equal volumes of gaseous N~2~, H~2~, and NH~3~, at the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules. Because one molecule of N~2~ reacts with three molecules of H~2~ to produce two molecules of NH~3~, the volume of H~2~ required is three times the volume of N~2~, and the volume of NH~3~ produced is two times the volume of N~2~.

This balloon contains a single space-filling model composed of two bonded blue spheres. This balloon is followed by a plus sign, then three grey balloons which are each labeled “H subscript 2.” Each of these balloons similarly contain a single space-filling model composed of two bonded white spheres. These white spheres are slightly smaller than the blue spheres. An arrow follows that points right to two light-green balloons, which are each labeled “2 NH subscript 3.” Each light-green balloon contains a space-filling model composed of a single central blue sphere to which three slightly smaller white spheres are bonded."}

### Greenhouse Gases and Climate Change

The thin skin of our atmosphere keeps the earth from being an ice planet and makes it habitable. In fact, this is due to less than 0.5% of the air molecules. Of the energy from the sun that reaches the earth, almost [[EQ:52]] is reflected back into space, with the rest absorbed by the atmosphere and the surface of the earth. Some of the energy that the earth absorbs is re-emitted as infrared (IR) radiation, a portion of which passes back out through the atmosphere into space. Most of this IR radiation, however, is absorbed by certain atmospheric gases, effectively trapping heat within the atmosphere in a phenomenon known as the *greenhouse effect*. This effect maintains global temperatures within the range needed to sustain life on earth. Without our atmosphere, the earth's average temperature would be lower by more than 30 °C (nearly 60 °F). The major greenhouse gases (GHGs) are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and ozone. Since the Industrial Revolution, human activity has been increasing the concentrations of GHGs, which have changed the energy balance and are significantly altering the earth’s climate ([↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_09_03_GlobalWarming"}).

There is strong evidence from multiple sources that higher atmospheric levels of CO~2~ are caused by human activity, with fossil fuel burning accounting for about [[EQ:53]] of the recent increase in CO~2~. Reliable data from ice cores reveals that CO~2~ concentration in the atmosphere is at the highest level in the past 800,000 years; other evidence indicates that it may be at its highest level in 20 million years. In recent years, the CO~2~ concentration has increased preindustrial levels of ~280 ppm to more than 400 ppm today ([↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_09_03_GlobalWarming2"}).

A slight distance outside the hemisphere is a grey arc. A line segment connects the label “Atmosphere” to the region between the hemisphere and the grey arc. In this region, near the surface of the earth the chemical formulas C O subscript 2, C H subscript 3, and N subscript 2 O appear. Five red arrows formed from wavy lines extend from green regions on the earth out into and just beyond the region labeled “Atmosphere.” The label “Infrared radiation” points to one of these red arrows. At a fair distance outside of the grey arc appears a yellow circle with a jagged boundary. This circle is labeled “Sun.” From it extend yellow arrows with wavy lines which extend toward the earth. Three of the arrows extend to the green region on the earth. One of the arrows appears to be reflected off the grey arc, causing its path to turn away from the earth."}

## Key Concepts and Summary

The ideal gas law can be used to derive a number of convenient equations relating directly measured quantities to properties of interest for gaseous substances and mixtures. Appropriate rearrangement of the ideal gas equation may be made to permit the calculation of gas densities and molar masses. Dalton’s law of partial pressures may be used to relate measured gas pressures for gaseous mixtures to their compositions. Avogadro’s law may be used in stoichiometric computations for chemical reactions involving gaseous reactants or products.
