Pressure of a Gas Collected Over Water

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idp35760544}}
If 0.200 L of argon is collected over water at a temperature of 26 °C and a pressure of 750 torr in a system like that shown in {{XREF:10}}, what is the partial pressure of argon?

{{SEG:m68752:para-title:fs-idp18515888-title}}
Solution

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idp18515888}}
According to Dalton’s law, the total pressure in the bottle (750 torr) is the sum of the partial pressure of argon and the partial pressure of gaseous water:

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idp135677552}}

Chemical Stoichiometry and Gases

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idp137887648}}
Chemical stoichiometry describes the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in chemical reactions.

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idp221629776}}
We have previously measured quantities of reactants and products using masses for solids and volumes in conjunction with the molarity for solutions; now we can also use gas volumes to indicate quantities. If we know the volume, pressure, and temperature of a gas, we can use the ideal gas equation to calculate how many moles of the gas are present. If we know how many moles of a gas are involved, we can calculate the volume of a gas at any temperature and pressure.

{{SEG:m68752:title:fs-idp45488016-title}}
Avogadro’s Law Revisited

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idm7424624}}
Sometimes we can take advantage of a simplifying feature of the stoichiometry of gases that solids and solutions do not exhibit: All gases that show ideal behavior contain the same number of molecules in the same volume (at the same temperature and pressure). Thus, the ratios of volumes of gases involved in a chemical reaction are given by the coefficients in the equation for the reaction, provided that the gas volumes are measured at the same temperature and pressure.

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idp21344160}}
We can extend Avogadro’s law (that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of the gas) to chemical reactions with gases: Gases combine, or react, in definite and simple proportions by volume, provided that all gas volumes are measured at the same temperature and pressure. For example, since nitrogen and hydrogen gases react to produce ammonia gas according to [[MATH:15]] a given volume of nitrogen gas reacts with three times that volume of hydrogen gas to produce two times that volume of ammonia gas, if pressure and temperature remain constant.

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idp16937680}}
The explanation for this is illustrated in {{XREF:11}}. According to Avogadro’s law, equal volumes of gaseous N~2~, H~2~, and NH~3~, at the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules. Because one molecule of N~2~ reacts with three molecules of H~2~ to produce two molecules of NH~3~, the volume of H~2~ required is three times the volume of N~2~, and the volume of NH~3~ produced is two times the volume of N~2~.

{{SEG:m68752:caption:CNX_Chem_09_03_Ammonia-caption}}
One volume of N~2~ combines with three volumes of H~2~ to form two volumes of NH~3~.

Propane, C~3~H~8~(*g*), is used in gas grills to provide the heat for cooking. What volume of O~2~(*g*) measured at 25 °C and 760 torr is required to react with 2.7 L of propane measured under the same conditions of temperature and pressure? Assume that the propane undergoes complete combustion.

{{SEG:m68752:para-title:fs-idp137922560-title}}
Solution

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idp137922560}}
The ratio of the volumes of C~3~H~8~ and O~2~ will be equal to the ratio of their coefficients in the balanced equation for the reaction:

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idp90728656}}
From the equation, we see that one volume of C~3~H~8~ will react with five volumes of O~2~:

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idp78474976}}
A volume of 13.5 L of O~2~ will be required to react with 2.7 L of C~3~H~8~.

Ammonia is an important fertilizer and industrial chemical. Suppose that a volume of 683 billion cubic feet of gaseous ammonia, measured at 25 °C and 1 atm, was manufactured. What volume of H~2~(*g*), measured under the same conditions, was required to prepare this amount of ammonia by reaction with N~2~?

{{SEG:m68752:para-title:fs-idp212669488-title}}
Solution

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idp212669488}}
Because equal volumes of H~2~ and NH~3~ contain equal numbers of molecules and each three molecules of H~2~ that react produce two molecules of NH~3~, the ratio of the volumes of H~2~ and NH~3~ will be equal to 3:2.

Greenhouse Gases and Climate Change

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idp143406944}}
The thin skin of our atmosphere keeps the earth from being an ice planet and makes it habitable. In fact, this is due to less than 0.5% of the air molecules. Of the energy from the sun that reaches the earth, almost [[MATH:21]] is reflected back into space, with the rest absorbed by the atmosphere and the surface of the earth. Some of the energy that the earth absorbs is re-emitted as infrared (IR) radiation, a portion of which passes back out through the atmosphere into space. Most of this IR radiation, however, is absorbed by certain atmospheric gases, effectively trapping heat within the atmosphere in a phenomenon known as the *greenhouse effect*. This effect maintains global temperatures within the range needed to sustain life on earth. Without our atmosphere, the earth's average temperature would be lower by more than 30 °C (nearly 60 °F). The major greenhouse gases (GHGs) are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and ozone. Since the Industrial Revolution, human activity has been increasing the concentrations of GHGs, which have changed the energy balance and are significantly altering the earth’s climate ({{XREF:12}}).

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idm12984240}}
There is strong evidence from multiple sources that higher atmospheric levels of CO~2~ are caused by human activity, with fossil fuel burning accounting for about [[MATH:22]] of the recent increase in CO~2~. Reliable data from ice cores reveals that CO~2~ concentration in the atmosphere is at the highest level in the past 800,000 years; other evidence indicates that it may be at its highest level in 20 million years. In recent years, the CO~2~ concentration has increased preindustrial levels of ~280 ppm to more than 400 ppm today ({{XREF:13}}).

{{SEG:m68752:caption:CNX_Chem_09_03_GlobalWarming-caption}}
Greenhouse gases trap enough of the sun’s energy to make the planet habitable—this is known as the greenhouse effect. Human activities are increasing greenhouse gas levels, warming the planet and causing more extreme weather events.

{{SEG:m68752:caption:CNX_Chem_09_03_GlobalWarming2-caption}}
CO~2~ levels over the past 700,000 years were typically from 200–300 ppm, with a steep, unprecedented increase over the past 50 years.

The ideal gas law can be used to derive a number of convenient equations relating directly measured quantities to properties of interest for gaseous substances and mixtures. Appropriate rearrangement of the ideal gas equation may be made to permit the calculation of gas densities and molar masses. Dalton’s law of partial pressures may be used to relate measured gas pressures for gaseous mixtures to their compositions. Avogadro’s law may be used in stoichiometric computations for chemical reactions involving gaseous reactants or products.
