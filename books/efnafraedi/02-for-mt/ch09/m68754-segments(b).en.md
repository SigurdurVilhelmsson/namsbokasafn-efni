A gas of unknown identity diffuses at a rate of 83.3 mL/s in a diffusion apparatus in which carbon dioxide diffuses at the rate of 102 mL/s. Calculate the molecular mass of the unknown gas.

When two cotton plugs, one moistened with ammonia and the other with hydrochloric acid, are simultaneously inserted into opposite ends of a glass tube that is 87.0 cm long, a white ring of NH~4~Cl forms where gaseous NH~3~ and gaseous HCl first come into contact. [[MATH:15]] At approximately what distance from the ammonia moistened plug does this occur? (Hint: Calculate the rates of diffusion for both NH~3~ and HCl, and find out how much faster NH~3~ diffuses than HCl.)
