with *k* being a constant. Graphically, this relationship is shown by the straight line that results when plotting the inverse of the pressure [[MATH:12]] versus the volume (*V*), or the inverse of volume [[MATH:13]] versus the pressure (*P*). Graphs with curved lines are difficult to read accurately at low or high values of the variables, and they are more difficult to use in fitting theoretical equations and parameters to experimental data. For those reasons, scientists often try to find a way to “linearize” their data. If we plot *P* versus *V*, we obtain a hyperbola (see {{XREF:8}}).

The relationship between the volume and pressure of a given amount of gas at constant temperature was first published by the English natural philosopher Robert Boyle over 300 years ago. It is summarized in the statement now known as __Boyle’s law__: *The volume of a given amount of gas held at constant temperature is inversely proportional to the pressure under which it is measured.*

{{SEG:m68751:para:fs-idm126059440}}
(a) Estimating from the *P*-*V* graph gives a value for *P* somewhere around 27 psi.

{{SEG:m68751:para:fs-idm112322224}}
(b) Estimating from the [[MATH:16]] versus *V* graph give a value of about 26 psi.

{{SEG:m68751:para:fs-idm124214336}}
(c) From Boyle’s law, we know that the product of pressure and volume (*PV*) for a given sample of gas at a constant temperature is always equal to the same value. Therefore we have *P*~1~*V*~1~ = *k* and *P*~2~*V*~2~ = *k* which means that *P*~1~*V*~1~ = *P*~2~*V*~2~.

{{SEG:m68751:para:fs-idm207111184}}
Using *P*~1~ and *V*~1~ as the known values 13.0 psi and 15.0 mL, *P*~2~ as the pressure at which the volume is unknown, and *V*~2~ as the unknown volume, we have:

Breathing and Boyle’s Law

{{SEG:m68751:para:fs-idm208195776}}
What do you do about 20 times per minute for your whole life, without break, and often without even being aware of it? The answer, of course, is respiration, or breathing. How does it work? It turns out that the gas laws apply here. Your lungs take in gas that your body needs (oxygen) and get rid of waste gas (carbon dioxide). Lungs are made of spongy, stretchy tissue that expands and contracts while you breathe. When you inhale, your diaphragm and intercostal muscles (the muscles between your ribs) contract, expanding your chest cavity and making your lung volume larger. The increase in volume leads to a decrease in pressure (Boyle’s law). This causes air to flow into the lungs (from high pressure to low pressure). When you exhale, the process reverses: Your diaphragm and rib muscles relax, your chest cavity contracts, and your lung volume decreases, causing the pressure to increase (Boyle’s law again), and air flows out of the lungs (from high pressure to low pressure). You then breathe in and out again, and again, repeating this Boyle’s law cycle for the rest of your life ({{XREF:15}}).

{{SEG:m68751:caption:CNX_Chem_09_02_BoylesLaw4-caption}}
Breathing occurs because expanding and contracting lung volume creates small pressure differences between your lungs and your surroundings, causing air to be drawn into and forced out of your lungs.

Moles of Gas and Volume: Avogadro’s Law

{{SEG:m68751:para:fs-idm52917120}}
The Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro advanced a hypothesis in 1811 to account for the behavior of gases, stating that equal volumes of all gases, measured under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules. Over time, this relationship was supported by many experimental observations as expressed by __Avogadro’s law__: *For a confined gas, the volume (V) and number of moles (n) are directly proportional if the pressure and temperature both remain constant*.

{{SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp65662512}}
In equation form, this is written as:

The Ideal Gas Law

{{SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp161797856}}
To this point, four separate laws have been discussed that relate pressure, volume, temperature, and the number of moles of the gas:

{{SEG:m68751:item:fs-idp25403616-item-1}}
Boyle’s law: *PV* = constant at constant *T* and *n*

{{SEG:m68751:item:fs-idp25403616-item-2}}
Amontons’s law: [[MATH:18]] = constant at constant *V* and *n*

{{SEG:m68751:item:fs-idp25403616-item-3}}
Charles’s law: [[MATH:19]] = constant at constant *P* and *n*

{{SEG:m68751:item:fs-idp25403616-item-4}}
Avogadro’s law: [[MATH:20]] = constant at constant *P* and *T*

{{SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp47645536}}
Combining these four laws yields the __ideal gas law__, a relation between the pressure, volume, temperature, and number of moles of a gas:

{{SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp83793536}}
where *P* is the pressure of a gas, *V* is its volume, *n* is the number of moles of the gas, *T* is its temperature on the kelvin scale, and *R* is a constant called the __ideal gas constant__ or the universal gas constant. The units used to express pressure, volume, and temperature will determine the proper form of the gas constant as required by dimensional analysis, the most commonly encountered values being 0.08206 L atm mol^–1^ K^–1^ and 8.314 kPa L mol^–1^ K^–1^.

{{SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp100115520}}
Gases whose properties of *P*, *V*, and *T* are accurately described by the ideal gas law (or the other gas laws) are said to exhibit *ideal behavior* or to approximate the traits of an __ideal gas__. An ideal gas is a hypothetical construct that may be used along with *kinetic molecular theory* to effectively explain the gas laws as will be described in a later module of this chapter. Although all the calculations presented in this module assume ideal behavior, this assumption is only reasonable for gases under conditions of relatively low pressure and high temperature. In the final module of this chapter, a modified gas law will be introduced that accounts for the *non-ideal* behavior observed for many gases at relatively high pressures and low temperatures.

{{SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp9263600}}
The ideal gas equation contains five terms, the gas constant *R* and the variable properties *P*, *V*, *n*, and *T*. Specifying any four of these terms will permit use of the ideal gas law to calculate the fifth term as demonstrated in the following example exercises.
