# The Kinetic-Molecular Theory

## Learning Objectives

- State the postulates of the kinetic-molecular theory
- Use this theory’s postulates to explain the gas laws
:::

The gas laws that we have seen to this point, as well as the ideal gas equation, are empirical, that is, they have been derived from experimental observations. The mathematical forms of these laws closely describe the macroscopic behavior of most gases at pressures less than about 1 or 2 atm. Although the gas laws describe relationships that have been verified by many experiments, they do not tell us why gases follow these relationships.

The **kinetic molecular theory**{id="term-00001"} (KMT) is a simple microscopic model that effectively explains the gas laws described in previous modules of this chapter. This theory is based on the following five postulates described here. (Note: The term “molecule” will be used to refer to the individual chemical species that compose the gas, although some gases are composed of atomic species, for example, the noble gases.)

The test of the KMT and its postulates is its ability to explain and describe the behavior of a gas. The various gas laws can be derived from the assumptions of the KMT, which have led chemists to believe that the assumptions of the theory accurately represent the properties of gas molecules. We will first look at the individual gas laws (Boyle’s, Charles’s, Amontons’s, Avogadro’s, and Dalton’s laws) conceptually to see how the KMT explains them. Then, we will more carefully consider the relationships between molecular masses, speeds, and kinetic energies with temperature, and explain Graham’s law.

## The Kinetic-Molecular Theory Explains the Behavior of Gases, Part I

Recalling that gas pressure is exerted by rapidly moving gas molecules and depends directly on the number of molecules hitting a unit area of the wall per unit of time, we see that the KMT conceptually explains the behavior of a gas as follows:

![](CNX_Chem_09_04_KMT2.jpg){id="CNX_Chem_09_04_KMT2" alt="This figure shows 3 pairs of pistons and cylinders. In a, which is labeled, “Charles’s Law,” the piston is positioned for the first cylinder so that just over half of the available volume contains 6 purple spheres with trails behind them. The trails indicate movement. Orange dashes extend from the interior surface of the cylinder where the spheres have collided. This cylinder is labeled, “Baseline.” In the second cylinder, the piston is in the same position, and the label, “Heat” is indicated in red capitalized text. Four red arrows with wavy stems are pointing upward to the base of the cylinder. The six purple spheres have longer trails behind them and the number of orange dashes indicating points of collision with the container walls has increased. A rectangle beneath the diagram states, “Temperature increased, Volume constant equals Increased pressure.” In b, which is labeled, “Boyle’s Law,” the first, baseline cylinder shown is identical to the first cylinder in a. In the second cylinder, the piston has been moved, decreasing the volume available to the 6 purple spheres to half of the initial volume. The orange dashes indicating points of collision with the container walls has increased. This second cylinder is labeled, “Volume decreased.” A rectangle beneath the diagram states, “Volume decreased, Wall area decreased equals Increased pressure.” In c, which is labeled “Avogadro’s Law,” the first, baseline cylinder shown is identical to the first cylinder in a. In the second cylinder, the number of purple spheres has changed from 6 to 12 and volume has doubled. This second cylinder is labeled “Increased gas.” A rectangle beneath the diagram states, “At constant pressure, More gas molecules added equals Increased volume.”"}

*Figure 9.31: (a) When gas temperature increases, gas pressure increases due to increased force and frequency of molecular collisions. (b) When volume decreases, gas pressure increases due to increased frequency of molecular collisions. (c) When the amount of gas increases at a constant pressure, volume increases to yield a constant number of collisions per unit wall area per unit time.*{id="CNX_Chem_09_04_KMT2"}

## Molecular Speeds and Kinetic Energy

The previous discussion showed that the KMT qualitatively explains the behaviors described by the various gas laws. The postulates of this theory may be applied in a more quantitative fashion to derive these individual laws. To do this, we must first look at speeds and kinetic energies of gas molecules, and the temperature of a gas sample.

In a gas sample, individual molecules have widely varying speeds; however, because of the *vast* number of molecules and collisions involved, the molecular speed distribution and average speed are constant. This molecular speed distribution is known as a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and it depicts the relative numbers of molecules in a bulk sample of gas that possesses a given speed ([↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_09_05_MolSpeed1"}).

![](CNX_Chem_09_05_MolSpeed1.jpg){id="CNX_Chem_09_05_MolSpeed1" class="scaled-down" alt="A graph is shown. The horizontal axis is labeled, “Speed u ( m divided by s ).” This axis is marked by increments of 20 beginning at 0 and extending up to 120. The vertical axis is labeled, “Fraction of molecules.” A positively or right-skewed curve is shown in red which begins at the origin and approaches the horizontal axis around 120 m per s. At the peak of the curve, a point is indicated with a black dot and is labeled, “v subscript p.” A vertical dashed line extends from this point to the horizontal axis at which point the intersection is labeled, “v subscript p.” Slightly to the right of the peak a second black dot is placed on the curve. This point is labeled, “v subscript r m s.” A vertical dashed line extends from this point to the horizontal axis at which point the intersection is labeled, “v subscript r m s.” The label, “O subscript 2 at T equals 300 K” appears in the open space to the right of the curve."}

*Figure 9.32: The molecular speed distribution for oxygen gas at 300 K is shown here. Very few molecules move at either very low or very high speeds. The number of molecules with intermediate speeds increases rapidly up to a maximum, which is the most probable speed, then drops off rapidly. Note that the most probable speed, ν~p~, is a little less than 400 m/s, while the root mean square speed, *u*~rms~, is closer to 500 m/s.*{id="CNX_Chem_09_05_MolSpeed1"}

The kinetic energy (KE) of a particle of mass (*m*) and speed (*u*) is given by:

[[EQ:1]]{id="fs-idm43195728"}

Expressing mass in kilograms and speed in meters per second will yield energy values in units of joules (J = kg m^2^ s^–2^). To deal with a large number of gas molecules, we use averages for both speed and kinetic energy. In the KMT, the **root mean square speed**{id="term-00002"} of a particle, *u*~rms~, is defined as the square root of the average of the squares of the speeds with *n* = the number of particles:

[[EQ:2]]{id="fs-idp57614544"}

The average kinetic energy for a mole of particles, KE~avg~, is then equal to:

[[EQ:3]]{id="fs-idm248247136"}

where *M* is the molar mass expressed in units of kg/mol. The KE~avg~ of a mole of gas molecules is also directly proportional to the temperature of the gas and may be described by the equation:

[[EQ:4]]{id="fs-idm181584464"}

where *R* is the gas constant and T is the kelvin temperature. When used in this equation, the appropriate form of the gas constant is 8.314 J/mol⋅K (8.314 kg m^2^s^–2^mol^–1^K^–1^). These two separate equations for KE~avg~ may be combined and rearranged to yield a relation between molecular speed and temperature:

If the temperature of a gas increases, its KE~avg~ increases, more molecules have higher speeds and fewer molecules have lower speeds, and the distribution shifts toward higher speeds overall, that is, to the right. If temperature decreases, KE~avg~ decreases, more molecules have lower speeds and fewer molecules have higher speeds, and the distribution shifts toward lower speeds overall, that is, to the left. This behavior is illustrated for nitrogen gas in [↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_09_05_MolSpeed2"}.

![](CNX_Chem_09_05_MolSpeed2.jpg){id="CNX_Chem_09_05_MolSpeed2" class="scaled-down" alt="A graph with four positively or right-skewed curves of varying heights is shown. The horizontal axis is labeled, “Speed u ( m divided by s ).” This axis is marked by increments of 500 beginning at 0 and extending up to 1500. The vertical axis is labeled, “Fraction of molecules.” The label, “N subscript 2,” appears in the open space in the upper right area of the graph. The tallest and narrowest of these curves is labeled, “100 K.” Its right end appears to touch the horizontal axis around 700 m per s. It is followed by a slightly wider curve which is labeled, “200 K,” that is about three quarters of the height of the initial curve. Its right end appears to touch the horizontal axis around 850 m per s. The third curve is significantly wider and only about half the height of the initial curve. It is labeled, “500 K.” Its right end appears to touch the horizontal axis around 1450 m per s. The final curve is only about one third the height of the initial curve. It is much wider than the others, so much so that its right end has not yet reached the horizontal axis. This curve is labeled, “1000 K.”"}

*Figure 9.33: The molecular speed distribution for nitrogen gas (N~2~) shifts to the right and flattens as the temperature increases; it shifts to the left and heightens as the temperature decreases.*{id="CNX_Chem_09_05_MolSpeed2"}

At a given temperature, all gases have the same KE~avg~ for their molecules. Gases composed of lighter molecules have more high-speed particles and a higher u~rms~, with a speed distribution that peaks at relatively higher speeds. Gases consisting of heavier molecules have more low-speed particles, a lower u~rms~, and a speed distribution that peaks at relatively lower speeds. This trend is demonstrated by the data for a series of noble gases shown in [↗]{ref="CNX_Chem_09_05_MolSpeed3"}.

This curve is labeled, “H e.”"}

## The Kinetic-Molecular Theory Explains the Behavior of Gases, Part II

According to Graham’s law, the molecules of a gas are in rapid motion and the molecules themselves are small. The average distance between the molecules of a gas is large compared to the size of the molecules. As a consequence, gas molecules can move past each other easily and diffuse at relatively fast rates.

The rate of effusion of a gas depends directly on the (average) speed of its molecules:

[[EQ:11]]{id="fs-idp1163392"}

Using this relation, and the equation relating molecular speed to mass, Graham’s law may be easily derived as shown here:

[[EQ:12]]{id="fs-idm166257280"}

[[EQ:13]]{id="fs-idm197441248"}

[[EQ:14]]{id="fs-idm136528624"}

The ratio of the rates of effusion is thus derived to be inversely proportional to the ratio of the square roots of their masses. This is the same relation observed experimentally and expressed as Graham’s law.

## Key Concepts and Summary

The kinetic molecular theory is a simple but very effective model that effectively explains ideal gas behavior. The theory assumes that gases consist of widely separated molecules of negligible volume that are in constant motion, colliding elastically with one another and the walls of their container with average speeds determined by their absolute temperatures. The individual molecules of a gas exhibit a range of speeds, the distribution of these speeds being dependent on the temperature of the gas and the mass of its molecules.
