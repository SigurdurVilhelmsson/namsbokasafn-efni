The study of the chemical behavior of gases was part of the basis of perhaps the most fundamental chemical revolution in history. French nobleman Antoine __Lavoisier__, widely regarded as the “father of modern chemistry,” changed chemistry from a qualitative to a quantitative science through his work with gases. He discovered the law of conservation of matter, discovered the role of oxygen in combustion reactions, determined the composition of air, explained respiration in terms of chemical reactions, and more. He was a casualty of the French Revolution, guillotined in 1794. Of his death, mathematician and astronomer Joseph-Louis Lagrange said, “It took the mob only a moment to remove his head; a century will not suffice to reproduce it.” [footnote: “Quotations by Joseph-Louis Lagrange,” last modified February 2006, accessed February 10, 2015, http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Quotations/Lagrange.html] Much of the knowledge we do have about Lavoisier's contributions is due to his wife, Marie-Anne Paulze Lavoisier, who worked with him in his lab. A trained artist fluent in several languages, she created detailed illustrations of the equipment in his lab, and translated texts from foreign scientists to complement his knowledge. After his execution, she was instrumental in publishing Lavoisier's major treatise, which unified many concepts of chemistry and laid the groundwork for significant further study.

As described in an earlier chapter of this text, we can turn to chemical stoichiometry for answers to many of the questions that ask “How much?” The essential property involved in such use of stoichiometry is the amount of substance, typically measured in moles (*n*). For gases, molar amount can be derived from convenient experimental measurements of pressure, temperature, and volume. Therefore, these measurements are useful in assessing the stoichiometry of pure gases, gas mixtures, and chemical reactions involving gases. This section will not introduce any new material or ideas, but will provide examples of applications and ways to integrate concepts already discussed.

Gas Density and Molar Mass

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idm206784496}}
The ideal gas law described previously in this chapter relates the properties of pressure *P*, volume *V*, temperature *T*, and molar amount *n*. This law is universal, relating these properties in identical fashion regardless of the chemical identity of the gas:

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idm169385680}}
The density *d* of a gas, on the other hand, is determined by its identity. As described in another chapter of this text, the density of a substance is a characteristic property that may be used to identify the substance.

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idm208643456}}
Rearranging the ideal gas equation to isolate *V* and substituting into the density equation yields

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idm191484432}}
The ratio *m*/*n* is the definition of molar mass, *ℳ*:

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idm475542288}}
The density equation can then be written

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idm178080080}}
This relation may be used for calculating the densities of gases of known identities at specified values of pressure and temperature as demonstrated in {{XREF:3}}.

When the identity of a gas is unknown, measurements of the mass, pressure, volume, and temperature of a sample can be used to calculate the molar mass of the gas (a useful property for identification purposes). Combining the ideal gas equation

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idm191612128}}
and the definition of molar mass

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idm482518736}}
yields the following equation:

Determining the Molecular Formula of a Gas from its Molar Mass and Empirical Formula

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idm20853312}}
Cyclopropane, a gas once used with oxygen as a general anesthetic, is composed of 85.7% carbon and 14.3% hydrogen by mass. Find the empirical formula. If 1.56 g of cyclopropane occupies a volume of 1.00 L at 0.984 atm and 50 °C, what is the molecular formula for cyclopropane?

{{SEG:m68752:para-title:fs-idp234218112-title}}
Solution

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idp234218112}}
First determine the empirical formula of the gas. Assume 100 g and convert the percentage of each element into grams. Determine the number of moles of carbon and hydrogen in the 100-g sample of cyclopropane. Divide by the smallest number of moles to relate the number of moles of carbon to the number of moles of hydrogen. In the last step, realize that the smallest whole number ratio is the empirical formula:

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idp144237600}}
Empirical formula is CH~2~ [empirical mass (EM) of 14.03 g/empirical unit].

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idp40237504}}
Next, use the provided values for mass, pressure, temperature and volume to compute the molar mass of the gas:

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idp221616976}}
Comparing the molar mass to the empirical formula mass shows how many empirical formula units make up a molecule:

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idm216078960}}
The molecular formula is thus derived from the empirical formula by multiplying each of its subscripts by three:

At [[MATH:5]] the flask is filled with volatile liquid gas at the same pressure as the atmosphere. If the flask is then cooled to room temperature, the gas condenses and the mass of the gas that filled the flask, and is now liquid, can be measured. (credit: modification of work by Mark Ott)

The Pressure of a Mixture of Gases: Dalton’s Law

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idp70155072}}
Unless they chemically react with each other, the individual gases in a mixture of gases do not affect each other’s pressure. Each individual gas in a mixture exerts the same pressure that it would exert if it were present alone in the container ({{XREF:6}}). The pressure exerted by each individual gas in a mixture is called its __partial pressure__. This observation is summarized by __Dalton’s law of partial pressures__: *The total pressure of a mixture of ideal gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the component gases*:

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idp97232880}}
In the equation *P~Total~* is the total pressure of a mixture of gases, *P~A~* is the partial pressure of gas A; *P~B~* is the partial pressure of gas B; *P~C~* is the partial pressure of gas C; and so on.

{{SEG:m68752:caption:CNX_Chem_09_03_DaltonLaw1-caption}}
If equal-volume cylinders containing gasses at pressures of 300 kPa, 450 kPa, and 600 kPa are all combined in the same-size cylinder, the total pressure of the gas mixture is 1350 kPa.

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idp110759216}}
The partial pressure of gas A is related to the total pressure of the gas mixture via its __mole fraction (*X*)__, a unit of concentration defined as the number of moles of a component of a solution divided by the total number of moles of all components:

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idp75739968}}
where *P~A~*, *X~A~*, and *n~A~* are the partial pressure, mole fraction, and number of moles of gas A, respectively, and *n~Total~* is the number of moles of all components in the mixture.

Collection of Gases over Water

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idp264029648}}
A simple way to collect gases that do not react with water is to capture them in a bottle that has been filled with water and inverted into a dish filled with water. The pressure of the gas inside the bottle can be made equal to the air pressure outside by raising or lowering the bottle. When the water level is the same both inside and outside the bottle ({{XREF:7}}), the pressure of the gas is equal to the atmospheric pressure, which can be measured with a barometer.

{{SEG:m68752:caption:CNX_Chem_09_03_WaterVapor-caption}}
When a reaction produces a gas that is collected above water, the trapped gas is a mixture of the gas produced by the reaction and water vapor. If the collection flask is appropriately positioned to equalize the water levels both within and outside the flask, the pressure of the trapped gas mixture will equal the atmospheric pressure outside the flask (see the earlier discussion of manometers).

{{SEG:m68752:para:fs-idp221722032}}
However, there is another factor we must consider when we measure the pressure of the gas by this method. Water evaporates and there is always gaseous water (water vapor) above a sample of liquid water. As a gas is collected over water, it becomes saturated with water vapor and the total pressure of the mixture equals the partial pressure of the gas plus the partial pressure of the water vapor. The pressure of the pure gas is therefore equal to the total pressure minus the pressure of the water vapor—this is referred to as the “dry” gas pressure, that is, the pressure of the gas only, without water vapor. The __vapor pressure of water__, which is the pressure exerted by water vapor in equilibrium with liquid water in a closed container, depends on the temperature ({{XREF:8}}); more detailed information on the temperature dependence of water vapor can be found in {{XREF:9}}, and vapor pressure will be discussed in more detail in the next chapter on liquids.
