During the seventeenth and especially eighteenth centuries, driven both by a desire to understand nature and a quest to make balloons in which they could fly ([#CNX_Chem_09_02_Ballooning]), a number of scientists established the relationships between the macroscopic physical properties of gases, that is, pressure, volume, temperature, and amount of gas. Although their measurements were not precise by today’s standards, they were able to determine the mathematical relationships between pairs of these variables (e.g., pressure and temperature, pressure and volume) that hold for an *ideal* gas—a hypothetical construct that real gases approximate under certain conditions. Eventually, these individual laws were combined into a single equation—the *ideal gas law*—that relates gas quantities for gases and is quite accurate for low pressures and moderate temperatures. We will consider the key developments in individual relationships (for pedagogical reasons not quite in historical order), then put them together in the ideal gas law.

In 1783, the first (a) hydrogen-filled balloon flight, (b) manned hot air balloon flight, and (c) manned hydrogen-filled balloon flight occurred. When the hydrogen-filled balloon depicted in (a) landed, the frightened villagers of Gonesse reportedly destroyed it with pitchforks and knives. The launch of the latter was reportedly viewed by 400,000 people in Paris.

Pressure and Temperature: Amontons’s Law

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idm131642544 -->
Imagine filling a rigid container attached to a pressure gauge with gas and then sealing the container so that no gas may escape. If the container is cooled, the gas inside likewise gets colder and its pressure is observed to decrease. Since the container is rigid and tightly sealed, both the volume and number of moles of gas remain constant. If we heat the sphere, the gas inside gets hotter ([#CNX_Chem_09_01_Amontons1]) and the pressure increases.

<!-- SEG:m68751:caption:CNX_Chem_09_01_Amontons1-caption -->
The effect of temperature on gas pressure: When the hot plate is off, the pressure of the gas in the sphere is relatively low. As the gas is heated, the pressure of the gas in the sphere increases.

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idm111816736 -->
This relationship between temperature and pressure is observed for any sample of gas confined to a constant volume. An example of experimental pressure-temperature data is shown for a sample of air under these conditions in [#CNX_Chem_09_02_Amontons2]. We find that temperature and pressure are linearly related, and if the temperature is on the kelvin scale, then *P* and *T* are directly proportional (again, when *volume and moles of gas are held constant*); if the temperature on the kelvin scale increases by a certain factor, the gas pressure increases by the same factor.

<!-- SEG:m68751:caption:CNX_Chem_09_02_Amontons2-caption -->
For a constant volume and amount of air, the pressure and temperature are directly proportional, provided the temperature is in kelvin. (Measurements cannot be made at lower temperatures because of the condensation of the gas.) When this line is extrapolated to lower pressures, it reaches a pressure of 0 at –273 °C, which is 0 on the kelvin scale and the lowest possible temperature, called absolute zero.

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idm33029376 -->
Guillaume Amontons was the first to empirically establish the relationship between the pressure and the temperature of a gas (~1700), and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac determined the relationship more precisely (~1800). Because of this, the *P*-*T* relationship for gases is known as either __Amontons’s law__ or __Gay-Lussac’s law__. Under either name, it states that *the pressure of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to its temperature on the kelvin scale when the volume is held constant*. Mathematically, this can be written:

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp12374848 -->
where ∝ means “is proportional to,” and *k* is a proportionality constant that depends on the identity, amount, and volume of the gas.

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idm100617456 -->
For a confined, constant volume of gas, the ratio [[MATH:1]] is therefore constant (i.e., [[MATH:2]]). If the gas is initially in “Condition 1” (with *P* = *P*~1~ and *T* = *T*~1~), and then changes to “Condition 2” (with *P* = *P*~2~ and *T* = *T*~2~), we have that [[MATH:3]] and [[MATH:4]] which reduces to [[MATH:5]] This equation is useful for pressure-temperature calculations for a confined gas at constant volume. Note that temperatures must be on the kelvin scale for any gas law calculations (0 on the kelvin scale and the lowest possible temperature is called __absolute zero__). (Also note that there are at least three ways we can describe how the pressure of a gas changes as its temperature changes: We can use a table of values, a graph, or a mathematical equation.)

(b) The gas in the can is initially at 24 °C and 360 kPa, and the can has a volume of 350 mL. If the can is left in a car that reaches 50 °C on a hot day, what is the new pressure in the can?

<!-- SEG:m68751:para-title:fs-idm152475936-title -->
Solution

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idm152475936 -->
(a) The can contains an amount of isobutane gas at a constant volume, so if the temperature is increased by heating, the pressure will increase proportionately. High temperature could lead to high pressure, causing the can to burst. (Also, isobutane is combustible, so incineration could cause the can to explode.)

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp91458240 -->
(b) We are looking for a pressure change due to a temperature change at constant volume, so we will use Amontons’s/Gay-Lussac’s law. Taking *P*~1~ and *T*~1~ as the initial values, *T*~2~ as the temperature where the pressure is unknown and *P*~2~ as the unknown pressure, and converting °C to K, we have:

Volume and Temperature: Charles’s Law

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idm19167872 -->
If we fill a balloon with air and seal it, the balloon contains a specific amount of air at atmospheric pressure, let’s say 1 atm. If we put the balloon in a refrigerator, the gas inside gets cold and the balloon shrinks (although both the amount of gas and its pressure remain constant). If we make the balloon very cold, it will shrink a great deal, and it expands again when it warms up.

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp60978480 -->
This [video](http://openstax.org/l/16CharlesLaw) shows how cooling and heating a gas causes its volume to decrease or increase, respectively.

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp49208960 -->
These examples of the effect of temperature on the volume of a given amount of a confined gas at constant pressure are true in general: The volume increases as the temperature increases, and decreases as the temperature decreases. Volume-temperature data for a 1-mole sample of methane gas at 1 atm are listed and graphed in [#CNX_Chem_09_02_Charles2].

<!-- SEG:m68751:caption:CNX_Chem_09_02_Charles2-caption -->
The volume and temperature are linearly related for 1 mole of methane gas at a constant pressure of 1 atm. If the temperature is in kelvin, volume and temperature are directly proportional. The line stops at 111 K because methane liquefies at this temperature; when extrapolated, it intersects the graph’s origin, representing a temperature of absolute zero.

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp38621856 -->
The relationship between the volume and temperature of a given amount of gas at constant pressure is known as Charles’s law in recognition of the French scientist and balloon flight pioneer Jacques Alexandre César Charles. __Charles’s law__ states that *the volume of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to its temperature on the kelvin scale when the pressure is held constant*.

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp174747472 -->
Mathematically, this can be written as:

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp134528 -->
with *k* being a proportionality constant that depends on the amount and pressure of the gas.

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp8180592 -->
For a confined, constant pressure gas sample, [[MATH:7]] is constant (i.e., the ratio = *k*), and as seen with the *P*-*T* relationship, this leads to another form of Charles’s law: [[MATH:8]]

<!-- SEG:m68751:para-title:fs-idp207430880-title -->
Solution

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp207430880 -->
Because we are looking for the volume change caused by a temperature change at constant pressure, this is a job for Charles’s law. Taking *V*~1~ and *T*~1~ as the initial values, *T*~2~ as the temperature at which the volume is unknown and *V*~2~ as the unknown volume, and converting °C into K we have:

Rearranging and solving gives: [[MATH:9]]

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp111256368 -->
This answer supports our expectation from Charles’s law, namely, that raising the gas temperature (from 283 K to 303 K) at a constant pressure will yield an increase in its volume (from 0.300 L to 0.321 L).

Measuring Temperature with a Volume Change

Temperature is sometimes measured with a gas thermometer by observing the change in the volume of the gas as the temperature changes at constant pressure. The hydrogen in a particular hydrogen gas thermometer has a volume of 150.0 cm^3^ when immersed in a mixture of ice and water (0.00 °C). When immersed in boiling liquid ammonia, the volume of the hydrogen, at the same pressure, is 131.7 cm^3^. Find the temperature of boiling ammonia on the kelvin and Celsius scales.

Volume and Pressure: Boyle’s Law

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idm87156432 -->
If we partially fill an airtight syringe with air, the syringe contains a specific amount of air at constant temperature, say 25 °C. If we slowly push in the plunger while keeping temperature constant, the gas in the syringe is compressed into a smaller volume and its pressure increases; if we pull out the plunger, the volume increases and the pressure decreases. This example of the effect of volume on the pressure of a given amount of a confined gas is true in general. Decreasing the volume of a contained gas will increase its pressure, and increasing its volume will decrease its pressure. In fact, if the volume increases by a certain factor, the pressure decreases by the same factor, and vice versa. Volume-pressure data for an air sample at room temperature are graphed in [#CNX_Chem_09_03_BoylesLaw1].

<!-- SEG:m68751:caption:CNX_Chem_09_03_BoylesLaw1-caption -->
When a gas occupies a smaller volume, it exerts a higher pressure; when it occupies a larger volume, it exerts a lower pressure (assuming the amount of gas and the temperature do not change). Since *P* and *V* are inversely proportional, a graph of [[MATH:11]] vs. *V* is linear.

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idm298625584 -->
Unlike the *P*-*T* and *V*-*T* relationships, pressure and volume are not directly proportional to each other. Instead, *P* and *V* exhibit inverse proportionality: Increasing the pressure results in a decrease of the volume of the gas. Mathematically this can be written:

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idm132946352 -->
with *k* being a constant. Graphically, this relationship is shown by the straight line that results when plotting the inverse of the pressure [[MATH:12]] versus the volume (*V*), or the inverse of volume [[MATH:13]] versus the pressure (*P*). Graphs with curved lines are difficult to read accurately at low or high values of the variables, and they are more difficult to use in fitting theoretical equations and parameters to experimental data. For those reasons, scientists often try to find a way to “linearize” their data. If we plot *P* versus *V*, we obtain a hyperbola (see [#CNX_Chem_09_02_Boyleslaw2]).

<!-- SEG:m68751:caption:CNX_Chem_09_02_Boyleslaw2-caption -->

The relationship between the volume and pressure of a given amount of gas at constant temperature was first published by the English natural philosopher Robert Boyle over 300 years ago. It is summarized in the statement now known as __Boyle’s law__: *The volume of a given amount of gas held at constant temperature is inversely proportional to the pressure under which it is measured.*

(c) From Boyle’s law, we know that the product of pressure and volume (*PV*) for a given sample of gas at a constant temperature is always equal to the same value. Therefore we have *P*~1~*V*~1~ = *k* and *P*~2~*V*~2~ = *k* which means that *P*~1~*V*~1~ = *P*~2~*V*~2~.

Breathing and Boyle’s Law

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idm208195776 -->
What do you do about 20 times per minute for your whole life, without break, and often without even being aware of it? The answer, of course, is respiration, or breathing. How does it work? It turns out that the gas laws apply here. Your lungs take in gas that your body needs (oxygen) and get rid of waste gas (carbon dioxide). Lungs are made of spongy, stretchy tissue that expands and contracts while you breathe. When you inhale, your diaphragm and intercostal muscles (the muscles between your ribs) contract, expanding your chest cavity and making your lung volume larger. The increase in volume leads to a decrease in pressure (Boyle’s law). This causes air to flow into the lungs (from high pressure to low pressure). When you exhale, the process reverses: Your diaphragm and rib muscles relax, your chest cavity contracts, and your lung volume decreases, causing the pressure to increase (Boyle’s law again), and air flows out of the lungs (from high pressure to low pressure). You then breathe in and out again, and again, repeating this Boyle’s law cycle for the rest of your life ([#CNX_Chem_09_02_BoylesLaw4]).

<!-- SEG:m68751:caption:CNX_Chem_09_02_BoylesLaw4-caption -->
Breathing occurs because expanding and contracting lung volume creates small pressure differences between your lungs and your surroundings, causing air to be drawn into and forced out of your lungs.

Moles of Gas and Volume: Avogadro’s Law

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idm52917120 -->
The Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro advanced a hypothesis in 1811 to account for the behavior of gases, stating that equal volumes of all gases, measured under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules. Over time, this relationship was supported by many experimental observations as expressed by __Avogadro’s law__: *For a confined gas, the volume (V) and number of moles (n) are directly proportional if the pressure and temperature both remain constant*.

The Ideal Gas Law

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp161797856 -->
To this point, four separate laws have been discussed that relate pressure, volume, temperature, and the number of moles of the gas:

<!-- SEG:m68751:item:fs-idp25403616-item-1 -->
Boyle’s law: *PV* = constant at constant *T* and *n*

<!-- SEG:m68751:item:fs-idp25403616-item-2 -->
Amontons’s law: [[MATH:18]] = constant at constant *V* and *n*

<!-- SEG:m68751:item:fs-idp25403616-item-3 -->
Charles’s law: [[MATH:19]] = constant at constant *P* and *n*

<!-- SEG:m68751:item:fs-idp25403616-item-4 -->
Avogadro’s law: [[MATH:20]] = constant at constant *P* and *T*

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp47645536 -->
Combining these four laws yields the __ideal gas law__, a relation between the pressure, volume, temperature, and number of moles of a gas:

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp83793536 -->
where *P* is the pressure of a gas, *V* is its volume, *n* is the number of moles of the gas, *T* is its temperature on the kelvin scale, and *R* is a constant called the __ideal gas constant__ or the universal gas constant. The units used to express pressure, volume, and temperature will determine the proper form of the gas constant as required by dimensional analysis, the most commonly encountered values being 0.08206 L atm mol^–1^ K^–1^ and 8.314 kPa L mol^–1^ K^–1^.

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp100115520 -->
Gases whose properties of *P*, *V*, and *T* are accurately described by the ideal gas law (or the other gas laws) are said to exhibit *ideal behavior* or to approximate the traits of an __ideal gas__. An ideal gas is a hypothetical construct that may be used along with *kinetic molecular theory* to effectively explain the gas laws as will be described in a later module of this chapter. Although all the calculations presented in this module assume ideal behavior, this assumption is only reasonable for gases under conditions of relatively low pressure and high temperature. In the final module of this chapter, a modified gas law will be introduced that accounts for the *non-ideal* behavior observed for many gases at relatively high pressures and low temperatures.

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp9263600 -->
The ideal gas equation contains five terms, the gas constant *R* and the variable properties *P*, *V*, *n*, and *T*. Specifying any four of these terms will permit use of the ideal gas law to calculate the fifth term as demonstrated in the following example exercises.

The Interdependence between Ocean Depth and Pressure in Scuba Diving

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp78164736 -->
Whether scuba diving at the Great Barrier Reef in Australia (shown in [#CNX_Chem_09_02_GreatBarri]) or in the Caribbean, divers must understand how pressure affects a number of issues related to their comfort and safety.

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp128156112 -->
Pressure increases with ocean depth, and the pressure changes most rapidly as divers reach the surface. The pressure a diver experiences is the sum of all pressures above the diver (from the water and the air). Most pressure measurements are given in units of atmospheres, expressed as “atmospheres absolute” or ATA in the diving community: Every 33 feet of salt water represents 1 ATA of pressure in addition to 1 ATA of pressure from the atmosphere at sea level. As a diver descends, the increase in pressure causes the body’s air pockets in the ears and lungs to compress; on the ascent, the decrease in pressure causes these air pockets to expand, potentially rupturing eardrums or bursting the lungs. Divers must therefore undergo equalization by adding air to body airspaces on the descent by breathing normally and adding air to the mask by breathing out of the nose or adding air to the ears and sinuses by equalization techniques; the corollary is also true on ascent, divers must release air from the body to maintain equalization. Buoyancy, or the ability to control whether a diver sinks or floats, is controlled by the buoyancy compensator (BCD). If a diver is ascending, the air in their BCD expands because of lower pressure according to Boyle’s law (decreasing the pressure of gases increases the volume). The expanding air increases the buoyancy of the diver, and they begin to ascend. The diver must vent air from the BCD or risk an uncontrolled ascent that could rupture the lungs. In descending, the increased pressure causes the air in the BCD to compress and the diver sinks much more quickly; the diver must add air to the BCD or risk an uncontrolled descent, facing much higher pressures near the ocean floor. The pressure also impacts how long a diver can stay underwater before ascending. The deeper a diver dives, the more compressed the air that is breathed because of increased pressure: If a diver dives 33 feet, the pressure is 2 ATA and the air would be compressed to one-half of its original volume. The diver uses up available air twice as fast as at the surface.

Standard Conditions of Temperature and Pressure

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp92943776 -->
We have seen that the volume of a given quantity of gas and the number of molecules (moles) in a given volume of gas vary with changes in pressure and temperature. Chemists sometimes make comparisons against a __standard temperature and pressure (STP)__ for reporting properties of gases: 273.15 K and 1 atm (101.325 kPa). [footnote: The IUPAC definition of standard pressure was changed from 1 atm to 1 bar (100 kPa) in 1982, but the prior definition remains in use by many literature resources and will be used in this text.] At STP, one mole of an ideal gas has a volume of about 22.4 L—this is referred to as the __standard molar volume__ ([#CNX_Chem_09_02_HENH3O2]).

<!-- SEG:m68751:caption:CNX_Chem_09_02_HENH3O2-caption -->

Key Concepts and Summary

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp19784464 -->
The behavior of gases can be described by several laws based on experimental observations of their properties. The pressure of a given amount of gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature, provided that the volume does not change (Amontons’s law). The volume of a given gas sample is directly proportional to its absolute temperature at constant pressure (Charles’s law). The volume of a given amount of gas is inversely proportional to its pressure when temperature is held constant (Boyle’s law). Under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, equal volumes of all gases contain the same number of molecules (Avogadro’s law).

<!-- SEG:m68751:para:fs-idp115685936 -->
The equations describing these laws are special cases of the ideal gas law, *PV* = *nRT*, where *P* is the pressure of the gas, *V* is its volume, *n* is the number of moles of the gas, *T* is its kelvin temperature, and *R* is the ideal (universal) gas constant.
