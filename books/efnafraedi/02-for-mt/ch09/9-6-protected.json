The first row is a header, and it labels each column, “Gas,” “a ( L to the second power a t m divided by m o l to the second power ),” “b ( L divided by m o l ).” Under “Gas” are the following: N subscript 2, O subscript 2, C O subscript 2, H subscript 2 O, H e, and C C l subscript 4. Under “a ( L to the second power a t m divided by m o l to the second power )” are the following: 1.39, 1.36, 3.59, 5.46, 0.0342, and 20.4.
