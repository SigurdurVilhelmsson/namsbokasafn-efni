After 30 minutes, the 500-mL bottle of water had cooled to the temperature of the refrigerator. An hour later, the 2-L of water had cooled to the same temperature. When asked which sample of water lost the most heat, one student replied that both bottles lost the same amount of heat because they started at the same temperature and finished at the same temperature. A second student thought that the 2-L bottle of water lost more heat because there was more water. A third student believed that the 500-mL bottle of water lost more heat because it cooled more quickly. A fourth student thought that it was not possible to tell because we do not know the initial temperature and the final temperature of the water.

            <div class="problem">
              <p>During a recent winter month in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, it was necessary to obtain 3500 kWh of heat provided by a natural gas furnace with 89% efficiency to keep a small house warm (the efficiency of a gas furnace is the percent of the heat produced by combustion that is transferred into the house).</p>
              <p>(a) Assume that natural gas is pure methane and determine the volume of natural gas in cubic feet that was required to heat the house. The average temperature of the natural gas was 56 °F; at this temperature and a pressure of 1 atm, natural gas has a density of 0.681 g/L.</p>
              <p>(b) How many gallons of LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) would be required to replace the natural gas used? Assume the LPG is liquid propane [C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>: density, 0.5318 g/mL; enthalpy of combustion, 2219 kJ/mol for the formation of CO<sub>2</sub>(<em>g</em>) and H<sub>2</sub>O(<em>l</em>)] and the furnace used to burn the LPG has the same efficiency as the gas furnace.</p>
              <p>(c) What mass of carbon dioxide is produced by combustion of the methane used to heat the house?</p>
              <p>(d) What mass of water is produced by combustion of the methane used to heat the house?</p>
              <p>(e) What volume of air is required to provide the oxygen for the combustion of the methane used to heat the house? Air contains 23% oxygen by mass. The average density of air during the month was 1.22 g/L.</p>
              <p>(f) How many kilowatt–hours (1 kWh = 3.6 <span class="katex" data-latex="{\times}"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em">×</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">{\times}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6667em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord">×</span></span></span></span></span></span> 10<sup>6</sup> J) of electricity would be required to provide the heat necessary to heat the house? Note electricity is 100% efficient in producing heat inside a house.</p>
              <p>(g) Although electricity is 100% efficient in producing heat inside a house, production and distribution of electricity is not 100% efficient. The efficiency of production and distribution of electricity produced in a coal-fired power plant is about 40%. A certain type of coal provides 2.26 kWh per pound upon combustion. What mass of this coal in kilograms will be required to produce the electrical energy necessary to heat the house if the efficiency of generation and distribution is 40%?</p>
