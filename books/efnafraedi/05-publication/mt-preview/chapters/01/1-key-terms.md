**accuracy**

how closely a measurement aligns with a correct value

**atóm** (*atom*)

smallest particle of an element that can enter into a chemical combination

**blanda** (*mixture*)

matter that can be separated into its components by physical means

**Celsius (°C)**

unit of temperature; water freezes at 0 °C and boils at 100 °C on this scale

**chemistry**

study of the composition, properties, and interactions of matter

**cubic centimeter (cm^3^ or cc)**

volume of a cube with an edge length of exactly 1 cm

**cubic meter (m^3^)**

SI unit of volume

**dimensional analysis**

(also, factor-label method) versatile mathematical approach that can be applied to computations ranging from simple unit conversions to more complex, multi-step calculations involving several different quantities

**eðlisbreyting** (*physical change*)

change in the state or properties of matter that does not involve a change in its chemical composition

**eðliseiginleiki** (*physical property*)

characteristic of matter that is not associated with any change in its chemical composition

**eðlismassi** (*density*)

ratio of mass to volume for a substance or object

**efnabreyting** (*chemical change*)

change producing a different kind of matter from the original kind of matter

**efnafræðilegur eiginleiki** (*chemical property*)

behavior that is related to the change of one kind of matter into another kind of matter

**efnasamband** (*compound*)

pure substance that can be decomposed into two or more elements

**efni** (*matter*)

anything that occupies space and has mass

**exact number**

number derived by counting or by definition

**extensive property**

property of a substance that depends on the amount of the substance

**Fahrenheit**

unit of temperature; water freezes at 32 °F and boils at 212 °F on this scale

**fast efni** (*solid*)

state of matter that is rigid, has a definite shape, and has a fairly constant volume

**frumefni** (*element*)

substance that is composed of a single type of atom; a substance that cannot be decomposed by a chemical change

**gas** (*gas*)

state in which matter has neither definite volume nor shape

**heterogeneous mixture**

combination of substances with a composition that varies from point to point

**hitastig** (*temperature*)

intensive property representing the hotness or coldness of matter

**homogeneous mixture**

(also, solution) combination of substances with a composition that is uniform throughout

**hreint efni** (*pure substance*)

homogeneous substance that has a constant composition

**hypothesis**

tentative explanation of observations that acts as a guide for gathering and checking information

property of a substance that is independent of the amount of the substance

**kelvin (K)**

SI unit of temperature; 273.15 K = 0 ºC

**kilogram (kg)**

standard SI unit of mass

**law**

statement that summarizes a vast number of experimental observations, and describes or predicts some aspect of the natural world

**law of conservation of matter**

when matter converts from one type to another or changes form, there is no detectable change in the total amount of matter present

**length**

measure of one dimension of an object

**liter (L)**

(also, cubic decimeter) unit of volume; 1 L = 1,000 cm^3^

**macroscopic domain**

realm of everyday things that are large enough to sense directly by human sight and touch

**massi** (*mass*)

fundamental property indicating amount of matter

**meter (m)**

standard metric and SI unit of length; 1 m = approximately 1.094 yards

**microscopic domain**

realm of things that are much too small to be sensed directly

**milliliter (mL)**

1/1,000 of a liter; equal to 1 cm^3^

**plasma** (*plasma*)

gaseous state of matter containing a large number of electrically charged atoms and/or molecules

**precision**

how closely a measurement matches the same measurement when repeated

**rounding**

procedure used to ensure that calculated results properly reflect the uncertainty in the measurements used in the calculation

**rúmmál** (*volume*)

amount of space occupied by an object

**sameind** (*molecule*)

bonded collection of two or more atoms of the same or different elements

**scientific method**

path of discovery that leads from question and observation to law or hypothesis to theory, combined with experimental verification of the hypothesis and any necessary modification of the theory

**second (s)**

SI unit of time

**SI units (International System of Units)**

standards fixed by international agreement in the International System of Units (*Le Système International d’Unités*)

**significant figures**

(also, significant digits) all of the measured digits in a determination, including the uncertain last digit

**symbolic domain**

specialized language used to represent components of the macroscopic and microscopic domains, such as chemical symbols, chemical formulas, chemical equations, graphs, drawings, and calculations

**theory**

well-substantiated, comprehensive, testable explanation of a particular aspect of nature

**uncertainty**

estimate of amount by which measurement differs from true value

**unit**

standard of comparison for measurements

**unit conversion factor**

ratio of equivalent quantities expressed with different units; used to convert from one unit to a different unit

**vökvi** (*liquid*)

state of matter that has a definite volume but indefinite shape

**weight**

force that gravity exerts on an object
