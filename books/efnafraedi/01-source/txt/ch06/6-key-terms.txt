Key Terms
amplitude
extent of the displacement caused by a wave
atomic orbital
mathematical function that describes the behavior of an electron in an atom (also called the wavefunction)

procedure in which the electron configuration of the elements is determined by “building” them in order of atomic numbers, adding one proton to the nucleus and one electron to the proper subshell at a time
blackbody
idealized perfect absorber of all incident electromagnetic radiation; such bodies emit electromagnetic radiation in characteristic continuous spectra called blackbody radiation
Bohr’s model of the hydrogen atom
structural model in which an electron moves around the nucleus only in circular orbits, each with a specific allowed radius
continuous spectrum
electromagnetic radiation given off in an unbroken series of wavelengths (e.g., white light from the sun)
core electron
electron in an atom that occupies the orbitals of the inner shells
covalent radius
one-half the distance between the nuclei of two identical atoms when they are joined by a covalent bond
d orbital
region of space with high electron density that is either four lobed or contains a dumbbell and torus shape; describes orbitals with l = 2.
degenerate orbitals
orbitals that have the same energy
effective nuclear charge
charge that leads to the Coulomb force exerted by the nucleus on an electron, calculated as the nuclear charge minus shielding
electromagnetic radiation
energy transmitted by waves that have an electric-field component and a magnetic-field component
electromagnetic spectrum
range of energies that electromagnetic radiation can comprise, including radio, microwaves, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays

energy change associated with addition of an electron to a gaseous atom or ion
electron configuration
listing that identifies the electron occupancy of an atom’s shells and subshells

rule stating that it is impossible to exactly determine both certain conjugate dynamical properties such as the momentum and the position of a particle at the same time. The uncertainty principle is a consequence of quantum particles exhibiting wave–particle duality
hertz (Hz)
the unit of frequency, which is the number of cycles per second, s−1

every orbital in a subshell is singly occupied with one electron before any one orbital is doubly occupied, and all electrons in singly occupied orbitals have the same spin
intensity
property of wave-propagated energy related to the amplitude of the wave, such as brightness of light or loudness of sound
interference pattern
pattern typically consisting of alternating bright and dark fringes; it results from constructive and destructive interference of waves
