A compound with a molar mass of about 42 g/mol contains 85.7% carbon and 14.3% hydrogen. What is its molecular structure?

Use the simulation to perform the following exercises for a two-atom molecule:
(a) Adjust the electronegativity value so the bond dipole is pointing toward B. Then determine what the electronegativity values must be to switch the dipole so that it points toward A.
(b) With a partial positive charge on A, turn on the electric field and describe what happens.
(c) With a small partial negative charge on A, turn on the electric field and describe what happens.
(d) Reset all, and then with a large partial negative charge on A, turn on the electric field and describe what happens.

Use the simulation to perform the following exercises for a real molecule. You may need to rotate the molecules in three dimensions to see certain dipoles.
(a) Sketch the bond dipoles and molecular dipole (if any) for O3. Explain your observations.
(b) Look at the bond dipoles for NH3. Use these dipoles to predict whether N or H is more electronegative.
(c) Predict whether there should be a molecular dipole for NH3 and, if so, in which direction it will point. Check the molecular dipole box to test your hypothesis.

Use the Molecule Shape simulator to build a molecule. Starting with the central atom, click on the double bond to add one double bond. Then add one single bond and one lone pair. Rotate the molecule to observe the complete geometry. Name the electron group geometry and molecular structure and predict the bond angle. Then click the check boxes at the bottom and right of the simulator to check your answers.
115. 
Use the Molecule Shape simulator to explore real molecules. On the Real Molecules tab, select H2O. Switch between the “real” and “model” modes. Explain the difference observed.

Use the Molecule Shape simulator to explore real molecules. On the Real Molecules tab, select “model” mode and S2O. What is the model bond angle? Explain whether the “real” bond angle should be larger or smaller than the ideal model angle.
