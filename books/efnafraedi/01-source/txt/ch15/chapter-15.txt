There is no change. A solid has an activity of 1 whether there is a little or a lot.
5. 
The solubility of silver bromide at the new temperature must be known. Normally the solubility increases and some of the solid silver bromide will dissolve.

 [Cl–] = 0.0056 M (b) The change in initial concentration of common ion may be neglected.
 [Ba2+] = 2.4  10–4 M

The changes in concentration are greater than 5% and thus exceed the maximum value for disregarding the change.

CaSO4∙2H2O is the most soluble Ca salt in mol/L, and it is also the most soluble Ca salt in g/L.

MnCO3 will form first since it has the smallest Ksp value among these homologous compounds and is therefore the least soluble. MgCO3•3H2O will be the last to precipitate since it has the largest K_sp value and is the most soluble. Ksp value.

(a) Ksp = [Mg2+][F–]2 = (1.21  10–3)(2  1.21  10–3)2 = 7.09  10–9
 (b) 7.09  10–7 M
 (c) Determine the concentration of Mg2+ and F– that will be present in the final volume. Compare the value of the ion product [Mg2+][F–]2 with Ksp. If this value is larger than Ksp, precipitation will occur. 
 0.1000 L  3.00  10–3 M Mg(NO3)2 = 0.3000 L  M Mg(NO3)2
 M Mg(NO3)2 = 1.00  10–3 M
 0.2000 L  2.00  10–3 M NaF = 0.3000 L  M NaF
 M NaF = 1.33  10–3 M
 ion product = (1.00  10–3)(1.33  10–3)2 = 1.77  10–9 This value is smaller than Ksp, so no precipitation will occur.
 (d) MgF2 is less soluble at 27 °C than at 18 °C. Because added heat acts like an added reagent, when it appears on the product side, the Le Châtelier’s principle states that the equilibrium will shift to the reactants’ side to counter the stress. Consequently, less reagent will dissolve. This situation is found in our case. Therefore, the reaction is exothermic.
