Key Terms
common ion effect
effect on equilibrium when a substance with an ion in common with the dissolved species is added to the solution; causes a decrease in the solubility of an ionic species, or a decrease in the ionization of a weak acid or base
complex ion
ion consisting of a central atom surrounding molecules or ions called ligands via coordinate covalent bonds
coordinate covalent bond
(also, dative bond) covalent bond in which both electrons originated from the same atom
coupled equilibria
system characterized the simultaneous establishment of two or more equilibrium reactions sharing one or more reactant or product
dissociation constant
(Kd) equilibrium constant for the decomposition of a complex ion into its components
formation constant
(Kf) (also, stability constant) equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex ion from its components
Lewis acid
any species that can accept a pair of electrons and form a coordinate covalent bond
Lewis acid-base adduct
compound or ion that contains a coordinate covalent bond between a Lewis acid and a Lewis base
Lewis acid-base chemistry
reactions involving the formation of coordinate covalent bonds
Lewis base
any species that can donate a pair of electrons and form a coordinate covalent bond
ligand
molecule or ion acting as a Lewis base in complex ion formation; bonds to the central atom of the complex
molar solubility
solubility of a compound expressed in units of moles per liter (mol/L)
selective precipitation
process in which ions are separated using differences in their solubility with a given precipitating reagent
solubility product constant (Ksp)
equilibrium constant for the dissolution of an ionic compound
