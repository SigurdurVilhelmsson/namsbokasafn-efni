Key Terms
addition reaction
reaction in which a double carbon-carbon bond forms a single carbon-carbon bond by the addition of a reactant. Typical reaction for an alkene.
alcohol
organic compound with a hydroxyl group (–OH) bonded to a carbon atom
aldehyde
organic compound containing a carbonyl group bonded to two hydrogen atoms or a hydrogen atom and a carbon substituent
alkane
molecule consisting of only carbon and hydrogen atoms connected by single (σ) bonds
alkene
molecule consisting of carbon and hydrogen containing at least one carbon-carbon double bond
alkyl group
substituent, consisting of an alkane missing one hydrogen atom, attached to a larger structure
alkyne
molecule consisting of carbon and hydrogen containing at least one carbon-carbon triple bond
amide
organic molecule that features a nitrogen atom connected to the carbon atom in a carbonyl group
amine
organic molecule in which a nitrogen atom is bonded to one or more alkyl group
aromatic hydrocarbon
cyclic molecule consisting of carbon and hydrogen with delocalized alternating carbon-carbon single and double bonds, resulting in enhanced stability
carbonyl group
carbon atom double bonded to an oxygen atom
carboxylic acid
organic compound containing a carbonyl group with an attached hydroxyl group
ester
organic compound containing a carbonyl group with an attached oxygen atom that is bonded to a carbon substituent
ether
organic compound with an oxygen atom that is bonded to two carbon atoms
functional group
part of an organic molecule that imparts a specific chemical reactivity to the molecule
ketone
organic compound containing a carbonyl group with two carbon substituents attached to it
organic compound
natural or synthetic compound that contains carbon
saturated hydrocarbon
molecule containing carbon and hydrogen that has only single bonds between carbon atoms
skeletal structure
shorthand method of drawing organic molecules in which carbon atoms are represented by the ends of lines and bends in between lines, and hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon atoms are not shown (but are understood to be present by the context of the structure)
substituent
branch or functional group that replaces hydrogen atoms in a larger hydrocarbon chain
substitution reaction
reaction in which one atom replaces another in a molecule
